      The CIPM decided to establish a CIPM Task Group on the Digital SI to explore and establish suitable liaisons with all relevant stakeholders aiming at agreeing an authoritative document on a meta-data format for SI-based data transfer as well as for machine-interpretable unambiguous digital representation of metrological information and factual data in general.

      The members of the Task Group are Dr Castelazo, Dr Liew, Dr Milton, Dr Olthoff, Dr Steele and Prof. Ullrich (Chair).

      It is recommended that it establishes an Expert Group recruited from NMIs. The Task Group is supported by the BIPM International Liaison and Communication Department.

      *Terms of Reference:*

      * To develop and establish a world-wide uniform, unambiguous and secure data exchange format for use in IoT networks based on the International System of Units (SI) described in the current SI Brochure.
      * To coordinate this effort with all relevant stakeholders by exploring and / or establishing suitable liaisons.
      * To propose suitable actions towards making the SI Brochure machine readable.

      The CIPM decided to expand the terms of reference of the CIPM Sub Committee on Strategy to include advice to the CIPM on wider strategic directions of metrology as follows:

      The CIPM Sub-Committee on Strategy will advise and support the CIPM on the following five areas:

      . responding to the evolving needs for metrology
      . addressing key scientific challenges to advance the global measurement system
      . strategy for deepening engagement with other international organizations on measurement science issues
      . reviewing the strategy for future membership of the organization
      . modernizing the operations of the organization

      The outcome should focus on what the CIPM can do to address these issues, reflecting them in the operation of the BIPM staff and laboratories. Regular reports should be given to the CIPM, with a consolidated report to the 27th meeting of the CGPM.

      The CGPM in Resolution 5 adopted at its 26th meeting (2018) decided that the CIPM shall implement Article 6 paragraph 8 of the Annexed Regulations, and that the CIPM shall address the situation where historical practice has resulted in the accumulation of arrears. Pursuant to this resolution, the CIPM decided that the BIPM shall inform States that have previously been notified of accumulated arrears exceeding the six-year period, that the amounts due are those equal to the first six years of default.

      The CIPM decided that any amounts paid by such States that constitute accumulated arrears exceeding the six-year period, may be considered when calculating their contribution, and entry contribution, following their re-engagement.

      This decision does not address the associated advances made by Member States, which shall be considered separately by the CIPM in the context of Resolution 5.

      * to review the associated financial data prepared by the BIPM staff
      * to explore options to address the advances associated with the accumulated arrears in a way that will be acceptable to the Member States that made the advances and to the external auditors, and

      or subscriptions successfully to the BIPM bank accounts in France due to the
      risk-averse policies of the French banks in the context of international sanction
      policies. The CIPM decided that such States shall not have their advantages
      and prerogatives suspended or be excluded, provided that genuine efforts have
      been made to pay their contributions or subscriptions, confirmed by refusal
      of acceptance by the banks holding the BIPM accounts. Such States should make
      the necessary arrangements to be in a position to transfer the due amounts as
      soon as it becomes possible.

      The CIPM decided that it would bestow honorary membership on Dr Barry Inglis in recognition of his accomplishments as the President of the CIPM with impact across the organization.

      He served as President of the CIPM for 8 years during which time he led the organization through two meetings of the CGPM. He led the CIPM through the governance review and subsequent launch of the reform of its processes. His work in coordinating the work of the CIPM with its Consultative Committees and the global NMI community led to the successful adoption of revised definitions for the SI units in 2018. He always took a strategic and long-term view of the impact of the CIPM on world metrology.

      noted that the BIPM was informed of two bank transfers being processed from the National Standards Organization of Iran for the settlement of the total sums due for 2013 and 2014 and that in view of the dates of these transfers, the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran with regard to its membership status since 1979 could not be included in the convocation to the 25th CGPM meeting.

      In order to allow the CGPM to duly address this position at its 26th meeting, the CIPM decided to provisionally freeze the effects of the Rescheduling Agreement made in 2012 through a new agreement that _inter alia_ requires continuity in payment of the Member State contribution by the Islamic Republic of Iran in the year it is due.

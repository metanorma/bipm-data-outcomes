      reviewed the advisory opinion received from the CCE (dated 7 June 2016), the available data on the financial position of the Pension Fund and the assumptions and expert advice received from the actuary (Mercer).

      The CIPM noted that the Mercer study projected that reaching long-term financial sustainability will require contributions from existing staff to reach 19.8 % for the Pre-2010 Section and 18.8 % for the Post-2010 Section. The CIPM considered the request from the staff representatives and agreed to reach these rates following a series of stepped increases.

      The modelling assumed that all staff joining the BIPM from 1 January 2017 will have reduced benefits and contribute at a level of 15 % of salary.

    message: In anticipation of the agreement of the proposed reforms to the BIPM
      Pension Fund with staff and following the Mercer study of 29 September 2016
      reviewed by the PFAB, the CIPM invited the PFAB to initiate an actuarial review
      of the Fund in 2019. This study will _inter alia_ allow the PFAB to consider
      the introduction of a choice for active staff to join the "Post 2017" section
      if they choose and also to confirm the maximum rates of contribution from staff
      needed to address the long-term financial stability of the Fund.

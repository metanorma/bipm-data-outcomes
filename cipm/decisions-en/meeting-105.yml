      reviewed the advisory opinion received from the CCE (dated 7 June 2016), the available data on the financial position of the Pension Fund and the assumptions and expert advice received from the actuary (Mercer).

      The CIPM noted that the Mercer study projected that reaching long-term financial sustainability will require contributions from existing staff to reach 19.8 % for the Pre-2010 Section and 18.8 % for the Post-2010 Section. The CIPM considered the request from the staff representatives and agreed to reach these rates following a series of stepped increases.

      The modelling assumed that all staff joining the BIPM from 1 January 2017 will have reduced benefits and contribute at a level of 15 % of salary.

    message: considered a request from an _association of 'anciens'_ of the BIPM to
      have a representative or observer on the PFAB. The CIPM noted that it maintains
      a high standard for transparency with respect to the operation and financial
      status of the Pension Fund. It also noted that the PFAB now includes an elected
      representative of the BIPM active staff and that active staff have a natural
      interest in the rights and benefits that they will receive as pensioners. The
      CIPM therefore does not consider it necessary to include a representative or
      observer of the association on the PFAB at this time.

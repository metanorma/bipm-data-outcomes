      welcomed the report from the Chair of the Pension Fund Advisory Board and noted the participative and consensus-building approach taken by the CIPM members and staff and pensioner representatives.

      The CIPM endorsed the 2019 Actuarial Study and considers it as an expert actuarial basis for its decision making to ensure the long-term financial stability of the Pension Fund.

      The CIPM decided to ask the Sub-Committee on Finance to explore the possibility and feasibility of authorizing exceptional contributions or voluntary injections of liquidity into the Fund pursuant to the discussions at the 2nd meeting of the CGPM and to articles 3.3 b) and c) of the Regulations of the Pension Fund.

      The CIPM noted Article 3 of the Regulations of the Pension Fund, and asked the BIPM Director to consider commissioning a new actuarial study before the next meeting of the CGPM if necessary.

      approved the amendments to Title IV (Service and Leave) of the RRI (Rules, Regulations and Instructions applicable to BIPM staff) as submitted in document CIPM/2020-07 (Annex 1). It noted that the CCE had been consulted and had submitted its advisory opinion expressing its views about the proposed measures. The CIPM was confident that the amendments will improve the conditions of employment of BIPM staff whilst serving the interests of both the staff and the BIPM. The new provisions of the RRI will enter into force as of 1 January 2021.

      The CIPM encouraged the BIPM Director to continue with the steps necessary to further modernize the RRI and to bring forward policies that reflect current standards of conduct expected from International Civil Servants.

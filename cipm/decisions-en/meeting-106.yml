      decided that when considering whether it is appropriate for an Associate State of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) to be encouraged to accede to the Metre Convention and hence become a Member State, it will take into account whether it has:

      * been an Associate State of the CGPM for at least 5 years,
      * a National Metrology Institute (NMI) that has signed the CIPM MRA,
      * published comparison results in the key comparison database (KCDB),

      * a percentage higher than 0.02 on the "_Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations_".

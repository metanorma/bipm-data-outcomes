      _In order to be informed of technical developments and evolving stakeholder needs in different areas of metrology, the CIPM has Consultative Committees with agreed scopes and the_ _following three objectives:_

      * _to progress the state-of-the art by providing a global forum for NMIs to exchange information about the state of the art and best practices,_
      * _to define new possibilities for metrology to have impact on global measurement challenges by facilitating dialogue between the NMIs and new and established stakeholders, and_
      * _to demonstrate and improve the global comparability of measurements. Particularly by working with the RMOs in the context of the CIPM MRA to:_
      ** _plan, execute and monitor KCs, and to_
      ** _support the process of CMC review._

      Document CIPM-D-01 will be updated accordingly.

      Following Decision CIPM/105-27 (on the engagement of international organizations as "liaisons" at the Consultative Committees), the CIPM decided that the status of liaison within the context of the Consultative Committees will be decided upon in each case by the CIPM. +
       +
      The CIPM will base its decision on the extent to which the international organization concerned meets the following criteria:

      * being international in structure and scope of activity, and representative of the specialized field of interest in which they operate;
      * being concerned with matters covering a part, or all, of the field of activity of the BIPM;
      * having aims and purposes in conformity with the Vision, Mission and Objectives of the BIPM;
      * having a permanent directing body and secretariat, authorized representatives and systematic procedures and machinery for communicating with its membership in various countries;
      * allowing its members to exercise voting rights in relation to its policies or action or having other appropriate mechanisms to express their views; and
      * having been established at least three years before they apply for liaison status.

      Organizations that are not offered liaison status within the context of the Consultative Committees will be known as "organizations in cooperation". +
       +
      Document CIPM-D-01 will be updated accordingly.

      decided that when considering whether it is appropriate for an Associate State of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) to be encouraged to accede to the Metre Convention and hence become a Member State, it will take into account whether it has:

      * been an Associate State of the CGPM for at least 5 years,
      * a National Metrology Institute (NMI) that has signed the CIPM MRA,
      * published comparison results in the key comparison database (KCDB),
      * one or more Calibration and Measurement Capability (CMC) listed in the KCDB,
      * a percentage higher than 0.02 on the "_Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations_".

      The above criteria will be applied in the implementation of Resolution 4 of the CGPM (2011) "_On the status of Associate State of the General Conference_". +
       +
      This decision revises the criteria adopted by the CIPM at its 98th (2009) and 99th (2010) meetings. +
       +
      The above notwithstanding, the CIPM reaffirmed that an Associate State of the CGPM may choose to accede to the Metre Convention and become a Member State at any time should it so wish.

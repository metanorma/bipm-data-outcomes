    message: noted that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has not paid its contributions
      for six years. Pursuant to Resolution 8 adopted by the CGPM at its 23rd meeting
      (2007) it has been sent a formal notification inviting it to fulfil its financial
      obligations and reminding it of the procedure governing the recovery of arrears
      and exclusion. The CIPM decided to recommend to the CGPM at its 26th meeting
      to take a decision with regard to the exclusion of the Bolivarian Republic of
      Venezuela in accordance with Article 6 of the Regulations annexed to the Metre
      Convention.

      expressed its appreciation and support for the work of the Chair of the Pension Fund Advisory Board (PFAB), the BIPM Director and Legal Advisor in respect of the implementation of its decisions, in particular concerning the long-term financial stability of the BIPM Pension Fund. +
       +
      The CIPM recalled the decision in 2008 of the Governing Body of the International Labour Organization (ILO) that observed that the BIPM, as an intergovernmental organization established by treaty, recognized the jurisdiction of the ILO Administrative Tribunal (ILOAT). The CIPM recognized the legal status of the BIPM as an intergovernmental organization and instructed the BIPM Director to continue to ensure as much as possible the legal certainty necessary for the implementation of its decisions. +
       +
      The CIPM recalled decision CIPM/104-48 and confirmed that informal discussions about the terminology used to refer to the BIPM serve to diminish the reputation of the organization and have the potential to damage confidence in its legal certainty. It confirmed that such discussions are closed.

      organize a vote by correspondence among the CCU members, with a deadline of
      the end of August 2018, as to whether to retain the wording of the draft 9th
      edition or to revert to the wording of the 8th edition, and to report back to
      the CIPM President for further action (if necessary).

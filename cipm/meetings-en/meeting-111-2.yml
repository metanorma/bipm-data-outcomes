      recalled Regulation 6 annexed to the Metre Convention (paragraph 6), which states that “The supplementary sums thus paid by these States to make up the dotation of the Bureau are considered as advances made to the State in arrears and are reimbursed to them in the event that it repays its arrears of contributions” and its Decision CIPM/108-33, following which States that have previously been notified of accumulated arrears exceeding the six-year period were informed that the amounts due are those equal to the first six years of default.

      The CIPM decided that supplementary sums received in respect of arrears greater than 6 years should be recognized, in all cases, as payments to the BIPM in the context of the re‐establishment of the dotation contributions required by paragraph 8 of Regulation 6 annexed to the Metre Convention.

      The CIPM requested the BIPM Director to draft the accounts for 2022 to show a table for inclusion in Note 5 of the Financial Report that shows the remaining supplementary sums that would be refunded to Member States if certain States in arrears were to make good their arrears (following article 20 para 3b of the Annexed Regulations).

      in the dotation each year. The CIPM asked the Director to prepare a balanced

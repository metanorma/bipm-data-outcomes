    message: considering that improved frequency values for radiations of some high-stability
      cold ion standards already documented in the recommended radiations list have
      recently become available;

    date_effective: '2003-01-01'
    message: considering that improved frequency values for the infra-red gas-cell-based
      optical frequency standard in the optical telecommunications region, already
      documented in the recommended radiations list, have been determined;

    message: considering that femtosecond comb-based frequency measurement for certain
      iodine gas-cell standards on the subsidiary recommended source list have recently
      been made for the first time, leading to signicantly reduced uncertainty;

      *proposes* that the _recommended radiation_ list be revised to include the following:

      * updated frequency values for the single trapped ^stem:[88^(Sr)]+^ ion quadrupole transition and the single trapped ^stem:[171^(Yb)]+^ octupole transition;
      * an updated frequency value for the stem:["C"_(2)"H"_(2)]-stabilized standard at 1.54 Âµm;
      * updated frequency values for the I~2~-stabilized standards at 543 nm and 515 nm.

      *decides* to introduce the following explanation in the brochure “Le Système International d'Unités (SI)”:

      The quantity dose equivalent stem:[H] is the product of the absorbed dose stem:[D] of ionizing radiation and the dimensionless factors stem:[Q] (quality factor) and stem:[N] (product of any other multiplying factors) stipulated by the International Commission on Radiological Protection:

      stem:[H = Q * N] · stem:[D].



      Thus, for a given radiation, the numerical value of stem:[H] in joules per kilogram may differ from that of stem:[D] in joules per kilogram depending upon the values of stem:[Q] and stem:[N]. In order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose stem:[D] and the dose equivalent stem:[H], the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose stem:[D] and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent stem:[H].
  notes: The CIPM, in 2002, decided to change the explanation of the quantity dose
    equivalent in the SI Brochure (Recommendation 2).

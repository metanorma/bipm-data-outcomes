      decides to introduce the following explanation in the brochure "Le Système International d'Unités (SI)": +

      The quantity dose equivalent stem:[H] is the product of the absorbed dose stem:[D] of ionizing radiation and the dimensionless factors stem:[Q] (quality factor) and stem:[N] (product of any other multiplying factors) stipulated by the International Commission on Radiological Protection:_H = Q · stem:["N"] · D._

      Thus, for a given radiation, the numerical value of stem:[H] in joules per kilogram may differ from that of stem:[D] in joules per kilogram depending upon the values of stem:[Q] and stem:[N]. In order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose stem:[D] and the dose equivalent stem:[H], the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose stem:[D] and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent stem:[H].

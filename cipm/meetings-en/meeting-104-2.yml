      *considering*

      * the good uniformity of world-wide mass measurements of NMIs in CCM.M-K4 (key comparison of stem:[1 "kg"] stainless steel standards),
      * that CMCs for mass calibrations at the level of stem:[1 "kg"] range from 28 µg to 1850 µg,
      * that determinations of the Planck constant will provide the basis for the future definition of the kilogram after the introduction of the “new SI”,
      * that an extraordinary calibration using the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK) took place at BIPM from January 2014 to January 2015,
      * that the as-maintained BIPM mass unit (traceable to the IPK at the 3rd Periodic Verification (3rd PV) 1988-1992) had changed over 22 years by 35 µg,
      * that a mathematical model established by BIPM was able to explain this change between the 3rd PV and 2014,
      * that the BIPM will update calibration certificates issued between 1.1.2003 and 31.12.2013 for calibrations of stem:[1 "kg"] mass standards,

      decides

      * that the published results of key comparisons carried out by the CCM will not be corrected, and that the WGD-kg will advise the RMOs about how degrees of equivalence may be linked in a way that maintains consistency,

    message: recommends that NMIs receiving updated calibration certificates from
      the BIPM should take appropriate action as regards the need to inform their
      customers and the correction of calibration certificates affected, and should
      take the updated mass values as the basis for their future calibrations.

    message: considered a request from an _association of 'anciens'_ of the BIPM to
      have a representative or observer on the PFAB. The CIPM noted that it maintains
      a high standard for transparency with respect to the operation and financial
      status of the Pension Fund. It also noted that the PFAB now includes an elected
      representative of the BIPM active staff and that active staff have a natural
      interest in the rights and benefits that they will receive as pensioners. The
      CIPM therefore does not consider it necessary to include a representative or
      observer of the association on the PFAB at this time.

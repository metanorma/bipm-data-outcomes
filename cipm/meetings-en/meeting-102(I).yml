      *recommends* the following changes to the list of “Recommended values of standard frequencies for applications including the practical realization of the metre and secondary representations of the second”:

      * that the following transition frequency be added to the list:
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 6s^2^ ^1^S~0~ - 6s 6p ^3^P~0~ of the ^199^ Hg neutral atom with a frequency of stem:[1 128 575 290 808 162 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of 1.7  × stem:[10^(-14)];

      * that the following transition frequencies be updated in the list:
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 4s ^2^S~1/2~ - 3d ^2^D~5/2~ of the ^stem:[40^(Ca)]+^ ion with a frequency of 411 stem:[042 129 776 395 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of 1.5  × stem:[10^(-14)];
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 1S - 2S of the stem:[""_(1) "H"] neutral atom with a frequency of 1 233 stem:[030 706 593 518 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.2 * 10^(-14)];

      Note: This frequency corresponds to half of the energy difference between the 1S and 2S states;

      * that the following transition frequencies be updated in the list and endorsed as secondary representations of the second:
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 6s ^2^S~1/2~ - 4f ^stem:[13^(6s)2]^ ^2^stem:["F"]~7/2~ of the ^stem:[171^(Yb)]+^ ion (octupole) with a frequency of stem:[642 121 496 772 645.6 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.3 * 10^(-15)];
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 6s^2^ ^1^S~0~ - 6s 6p ^3^P~0~ of the ^171^Yb neutral atom with a frequency of stem:[518 295 836 590 865.0 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[2.7 * 10^(-15)];
      * that the following transition frequency be added to the list and as a secondary representation of the second:
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 3s^2^ ^1^S~0~ - 3s 3p ^3^P~0~ of the ^stem:[27^(Al)]+^ ion with a frequency of 1 stem:[121 015 393 207 857.3 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.9 * 10^(-15)];
      * that the following transition frequencies be updated in the list and as secondary representations of the second:
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 5d ^10^6s ^2^S~1/2~ - 5d ^stem:[9^(6s)2]^ ^2^D~5/2~ of the ^stem:[199^(Hg)]+^ ion with a frequency of stem:[1 064 721 609 899 145.3 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.9 * 10^(-15)];
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 6s ^2^S~1/2~ (stem:[F = 0], stem:[m_("F") = 0]) - 5d ^2^D~3/2~ (stem:[F = 2], stem:[m_("F") = 0]) of the ^stem:[171^(Yb)]+^ ion (quadrupole) with a frequency of stem:[688 358 979 309 307.1 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[3 * 10^(-15)];
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 5s ^2^S~1/2~ - 4d ^2^D~5/2~ of the ^stem:[88^(Sr)]+^ ion with a frequency of 444 stem:[779 044 095 485.3 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[4.0 * 10^(-15)];
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 5s^2^ ^1^S~0~ - 5s5p ^3^P~0~ of the ^87^Sr neutral atom with a frequency of stem:[429 228 004 229 873.4 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1 * 10^(-15)];
      * that the following transition frequency be updated as a secondary representation of the second:
      ** the unperturbed ground - state hyperfine transition of ^87^Rb with a frequency of 6 834 682 stem:[610.904 312 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.3 * 10^(-15)].

      Note: The value of the estimated standard uncertainty is assumed to correspond to a confidence level of 68 %. However, given the very limited number of available data there is a possibility that in hindsight this might not prove to be exact.

      16.3 Notice of resignation

      The notices of resignation mentioned in Regulations 16.1 and 16.2 shall be submitted in writing against a signed and dated receipt by the Director or his representative.

      16.3.1 Exemption from duty during the notice period

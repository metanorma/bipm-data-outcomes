      *considering* that

      * the current definition of the SI unit of dose equivalent (sievert) includes a factor "stem:[N]" (product of any other multiplying factors) stipulated by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), and
       +
      * both the ICRP and the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) have decided to delete this factor stem:[N] as it is no longer deemed to be necessary, and
       +
      * the current SI definition of stem:[H] including the factor stem:[N] is causing some confusion,

      *decides* to change the explanation in the brochure "Le Système International d'Unités (SI)" to the following:

      The quantity dose equivalent stem:[H] is the product of the absorbed dose stem:[D] of ionizing radiation and the dimensionless factor stem:[Q] (quality factor) defined as a function of linear energy transfer by the ICRU: +

      stem:[H = Q * D]

      Thus, for a given radiation, the numerical value of stem:[H] in joules per kilogram may differ from that of stem:[D] in joules per kilogram depending on the value of stem:[Q].

      The Committee further *decides* to maintain the final sentence in the explanation as follows:

      In order to avoid any risk of confusion between the absorbed dose stem:[D] and the dose equivalent stem:[H], the special names for the respective units should be used, that is, the name gray should be used instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of absorbed dose stem:[D] and the name sievert instead of joules per kilogram for the unit of dose equivalent stem:[H].

      *considering* that:

      * improved frequency values of molecules in the optical telecommunications region, already documented in the list of standard frequencies, have been determined by femtosecond comb-based frequency measurements;
      * frequencies of molecules in the optical telecommunications region have been determined by femtosecond comb-based frequency measurements for the first time;
      * frequencies of certain iodine gas-cell absorptions close to the 532 nm optical frequency standard have been determined by femtosecond comb-based frequency measurements for the first time;

      *proposes* that the list of standard frequencies be revised to include the following:

      * an updated list of frequency values for the stem:[""_(12) "C"_(2)"H"_(2) ( nu 1 +  nu 3)] band at 1.54 µm;
      * the addition of frequency values for the stem:[""_(12) "C"_(2)]HD stem:[(2 nu 1)] band at 1.54 µm;
      * the addition of frequency values for the hyperfine components of the P(142) 37-0, R(121) 35-0 and R(85) 33-0 iodine transitions at 532 nm.

  - message: The International Committee for Weights and Measures,
  considerations:
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-11-09'
    message: considering that most laser interferometers and many other measuring
      instruments used for length measurement are based on 633 nm He-Ne lasers;
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-11-09'
    message: considering that these instruments are often used at uncertainty levels
      that are large compared to the possible variation of the He-Ne laser vacuum
      wavelength;
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-11-09'
    message: considering that the vacuum wavelength of the unstabilized 633 nm He-Ne
      laser is restricted to within a narrow range by fundamental quantum phenomena;
  - type: recognizing
    date_effective: '2007-11-09'
    message: |-
      *recognizing*

      * that it would be necessary to provide guidance and documentary evidence concerning the value of the vacuum wavelength and its uncertainty that can be expected in the absence of calibration;
      * that such evidence could help to avoid unnecessary calibrations of these lasers in such applications;

      recommends

      * that the values +
      stem:[f = 473.612 7 "THz"] +
      _λ_ = 632.990 8 nm +
       with a relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.5 * 10^(-6)], apply to the radiation in vacuum of a unstabilised helium-neon laser operating solely on the 3s~2~→2p~4~ transition, independent of the isotopic mixture of the neon;
      * that an entry for unstabilized helium-neon lasers, operating on the 633 nm (3s~2~→2p~4~) neon transition, be included in the second category of the list of standard frequencies, and that an accompanying paper with CCL authority be published in Metrologia.

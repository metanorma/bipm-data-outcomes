      endorsed _Metrologia_ as its journal of choice for reporting advances in pure and applied metrology at the highest level, including the best research work undertaken by NMIs and under the auspices of the CIPMâ€™s Consultative Committees and Forums.

      The CIPM asked the Consultative Committees and Forums each to nominate one or more ambassadors to __Metrologia__, to strengthen the link between these bodies and _Metrologia_ and identify topics of interest for Focus Issues.

      In the interest of the whole metrology community, the CIPM asked the BIPM to pursue an Open Access publishing model for the journal, even if this results in a loss of revenue to the BIPM.

      The CIPM recommended the creation of a separate entity for the publication of comparison reports and asked the BIPM to identify and implement an appropriate mechanism for this.

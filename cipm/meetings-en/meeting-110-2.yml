      Following the recommendations dated 7 September 2020 from the Pension Fund Advisory Board (PFAB) and the recommendations from the CIPM Sub-Committee on Finance meeting held on 6 October 2021, the CIPM decided to authorize the exceptional transfer of 3 million € of unreserved cash to the Pension Fund in 2021.

      The CIPM also decided to consider a further exceptional transfer in 2022 following the publication of the audited financial report for 2021 and the development of a long-term financial plan for the BIPM.

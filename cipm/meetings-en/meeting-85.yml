    message: |-
      *recommends*

      * that the reference times (modulo 1 second) of satellite navigation systems with global coverage\* be synchronized as closely as possible to UTC,
      * that the reference frames for these systems be transformed to be in conformity with the terrestrial reference frame maintained by the International Earth Rotation Service (ITRF),
      * that both GPS and GLONASS receivers be used at timing centres.

      \* Such as Global Positioning System (GPS). Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT), Global Navigation Satellite System 1 (GNSSI), Global Navigation Satellite System 2 (GNSS2).

  - message: The Comité International des Poids et Mesures,
  considerations:
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1996-09-26'
    message: considering that the Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures has adopted
      a series of prefixes to be used in forming the decimal multiples and sub-multiples
      of SI units,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1996-09-26'

      to express multiples of units such as the bit and byte,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1996-09-26'
    message: considering that the use of the SI prefixes in information technology
      to express binary multiples of such units leads to confusion,

    message: _recalling_ that the SI prefixes represent strictly powers of ten,
  - type: noting
    date_effective: '1996-09-26'
    message: _noting_ that work is under way, notably within the International Electrotechnical
      Commission (IEC) but also in other organizations, aimed at finding alternative

      *LIST OF RECOMMENDED RADIATIONS, 1992*



      This list replaces the one published in __BIPM Proc.-Verb. Corn. Int. Poids et Mesures__, 1983,**51**, 25-28 and __Metrologia__, 1984, **19**, 165-166.

      In this list, the values of the frequency stem:[f] and of the wavelength _λ_ should be related exactly by the relation _λ_ stem:[f] = __c__, with stem:[c = 299 792 458 "m"/"s"] but the values of _λ_ are rounded.

      The data and analysis used for the compilation of this list are set out in the associated Appendix: Source Data for the List of Recommended Radiations, 1992 and its Annotated Bibliography*.

      It should be noted that for several of the listed radiations, few independent values are available, so that the estimated uncertainties may not, therefore, reflect all sources of variability.

      Each of the listed radiations can be replaced, without degrading the accuracy, by a radiation corresponding to another component of the same transition or by another radiation, when the frequency difference is known with sufficient accuracy. It should be also noted that to achieve the uncertainties given here it is not sufficient just to meet the specifications for the listed parameters. In addition, it is necessary to follow the best good practice concerning methods of stabilization as described in numerous scientific and technical publications. References to appropriate articles, illustrating accepted good practice for a particular radiation, may be obtained by application to a member laboratory of the CCDM, or to the BIPM.
      *_1. Radiations of Stabilized Lasers_*

      1.1. Absorbing molecule CH~4~, transition stem:["V"_(3)], P (7), component stem:["F"_(2)]^(2)^.

      1.1.1. The values +
      stem:[f = 88 376 181 600","18 "kHz"] +
      _λ_ = 3 392 231 397,327 fm +
      with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[3 * 10^(-12)] apply to the radiation of a He-Ne laser stabilized to the central component [(7-6) transition] of the resolved hyperfine-structure triplet, the mean of recoil splitting, for effectively stationary molecules, i.e. the values are corrected for second order Doppler shift.

      1.1.2. The values +
      stem:[f = 88 376 181 600","5 "kHz"] +
      _λ_ = stem:[3 392 231 397","31 "m"] +
      with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[2","3 * 10^(-11)] apply to the radiation of a He-Ne laser stabilized to the centre of the unresolved hyperfine structure of a room temperature methane cell, within or external to the laser, subject to the following conditions:

      * methane pressure ≤ 3 Pa
      * mean one-way axial intracavity surface power density
      +
      ^+^
      +
      ≤ 10

      * radius of wavefront curvature  ≥ stem:[1 "m"]
      * inequality of power between counter-propagating waves ≤ 5 %
      * detector placed at the output facing the laser tube.

      \* The appendix referred to above is published in the Report of the 8th meeting of the CCDM (1992).

      1.2. Absorbing atom ^40^Ca, transition ^3^P~1~ - ^1^S~0~; stem:[ sf Delta ]__m__~stem:["J"]~ = 0.

      The values +
      stem:[f = 455 986 240","5 "MHz"] +
      _λ_ = 657 459 439,3 fm +
      with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[4","5 * 10^(-10)] apply to the radiation of a laser stabilized with a thermal atomic beam.

      1.3. Absorbing molecule ^127^I~2~, transition 8-5, P(10), component a~9~ (or stem:["g"]).

      The values +
      stem:[f = 468 218 332","4 "MHz"] +
      _λ_ = 640 283 468,7 fm +
      with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[4","5 * 10^(-10)] apply to the radiation of a He-Ne laser stabilized with an internal iodine cell having a cold finger temperature of stem:[(16  +-  1) "°C"] and a frequency modulation width, peak to peak, of stem:[(6  +-  1) "MHz"].

      1.4. Absorbing molecule ^127^I~2~, transition 11-5, R(127), component a~l3~ (or i).

      The values +
      stem:[f= 473 612 214 705 "kHz"] +
      _λ_ = 632 991 398,22 fm +
      with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[2","5 * 10^(-11)] apply to the radiation of a He-Ne laser with an internal iodine ceIl, subject to the conditions:

      * cell-wall temperature: stem:[(25  +-  5) "°C"]
      * cold finger temperature: stem:[(15  +-  0","2) "°C"]
      * frequency modulation width, peak to peak: stem:[(6  +-  0","3) "MHz"]
      * one-way intracavity beam power+: stem:[(10  +-  5) "mW"], for an absolute value of the power shift coefficient ≤ 1,4 kHzlmW.

      These conditions are by themselves insufficient to ensure that the stated standard uncertainty will be achieved. It is also necessary for the optical and electronic control systems to be operating with the appropriate technical performance. The iodine cell may also be operated under relaxed conditions, leading to the larger uncertainty specified in Appendix M2 of the CCDM Report (1992).

      1.5. Absorbing molecule ^127^I~2~, transition 9-2, R(47), component a~7~ (or o).

      with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[4 * 10^(-10)] apply to the radiation of a dye laser (or frequency-doubled He-Ne laser) stabilized with an iodine ceIl, within or external to the laser, having a cold-finger temperature of stem:[(6  +-  2)] °C.

      1.7. Absorbing molecule ^127^I~2~, transition 26-0, R(12), component a~9~

      The values +
      stem:[f = 551579482","96 "MHz"] +
      _λ_ = 543516333,1 fm +
      with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[2","5 * 10^(-10)] apply to the radiation of a frequency stabilized He-Ne laser with an external iodine cell having a cold-finger temperature of stem:[(0  +-  2)] °c.

      1.8. Absorbing molecule ^127^I~2~, transition 43-0, P(13), component a~3~ (or stem:["s"]).

      The values +
      stem:[f = 582 490 603","37 "MHz"] +
      _λ_ = 514 673 466,4 fm +
      with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[2","5 * 10^(-10)] apply to the radiation of an Ar^+^ laser stabilized with an iodine cell external to the laser, having a cold-finger temperature of (- stem:[5  +-  2]) °C.

      Note +
      ^+^ The one-way intracavity beam power is obtained by dividing the output power by the transrnittance of the output mirror.

      The value +
      _λ_ = 605 780 210,3 fm +
      with an estimated overall relative uncertainty of stem:[ +-  4 * 10^(-9)] [equivalent to three times the relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1","3 * 10^(-9)]] applies to the radiation emitted by a lamp operated under the conditions recommended by the CIPM (__BlPM Proc.-Verb. Corn. Int. Poids et Mesures__, 1960, **28**, 71-72 and __BlPM Comptes Rendus lle Conf. Gén. Poids et Mesures__, 1960, 85)].

      2.2. Radiations of atoms ^86^Kr, ^198^Hg and ^114^Cd recommended by the CIPM in 1963 (__BIPM Corn. Cons. Déf. Mètre__, 1962, **3**, 18-19 and __BIPM Proc. Verb. Com. Int.

  approvals:
  - type: affirmative
    degree: unanimous
    message: The Comité International des Poids et Mesures,
  considerations:
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1999-10-15'
    message: considering that the International Committee already recommended “that
      the reference times (modulo 1 second) of satellite navigation systems with global
      coverage be synchronized as closely as possible with UTC” and “that the reference
      frames for these systems be transformed to be in conformity with the ITRF”,
      Recommendation 1 (CI-1996),
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1999-10-15'
    message: considering that both the GPS and GLONASS systems follow these guidelines,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1999-10-15'
    message: considering that these systems are now widely used for time and frequency
      comparisons,

  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '1999-10-15'
    message: |-
      *recommends* that

      * all global navigation satellite systems be designed so that it is possible to use their signals for time and frequency comparisons,
      * these systems broadcast, in addition to their own System Time (ST):
      .. the time difference between ST and a real-time realization of UTC and TAI;
      .. a prediction of the time differences between ST and UTC and TAI,
      * manufacturers develop receivers and processing systems designed for time and frequency comparison purposes.

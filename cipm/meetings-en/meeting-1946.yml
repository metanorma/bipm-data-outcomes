    message: Unit of force - The unit of force [in the MKS (metre, kilogram, second)
      system] is the force which gives to a mass of 1 kilogram an acceleration of
      1 metre per second, per second.
  - type: decides
    date_effective: '1946-01-01'
    message: Joule (unit of energy or work) - The joule is the work done when the
      point of application of 1 MKS unit of force [newton] moves a distance of 1 metre
      in the direction of the force.

      Watt (unit of power) - The watt is the power which in one second gives rise to energy of 1 joule.

      (B) Definitions of electric units. The Comit√© International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) accepts the following propositions which define the theoretical value of the electric units:
  - type: decides
    date_effective: '1946-01-01'
    message: Ampere (unit of electric current) - The ampere is that constant current
      which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length,
      of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 metre apart in vacuum, would
      produce between these conductors a force equal to stem:[2 * 10^(-7)] MKS unit
      of force [newton] per metre of length.
  - type: decides
    date_effective: '1946-01-01'
    message: Volt (unit of potential difference and of electromotive force) - The
      volt is the potential difference between two points of a conducting wire carrying
      a constant current of 1 ampere, when the power dissipated between these points
      is equal to 1 watt.
  - type: decides
    date_effective: '1946-01-01'
    message: Ohm (unit of electric resistance) - The ohm is the electric resistance
      between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of 1
      volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of 1 ampere,
      the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.

    message: Farad (unit of capacitance) - The farad is the capacitance of a capacitor
      between the plates of which there appears a potential difference of 1 volt when
      it is charged by a quantity of electricity of 1 coulomb.

    message: Henry (unit of electric inductance) - The henry is the inductance of
      a closed circuit in which an electromotive force of 1 volt is produced when
      the electric current in the circuit varies uniformly at the rate of 1 ampere
      per second.

    message: Weber (unit of magnetic flux) - The weber is the magnetic flux which,
      linking a circuit of one turn, would produce in it an electromotive force of
      1 volt if it were reduced to zero at a uniform rate in 1 second.

      . The photometric units may be defined as follows: +
       +
      *_New candle_* (unit of luminous intensity). — The value of the new candle is such that the brightness of the full radiator at the temperature of solidification of platinum is 60 new candles per square centimetre. +
      *_New lumen_* (unit of luminous flux). — The new lumen is the luminous flux emitted in unit solid angle (steradian) by a uniform point source having a luminous intensity of 1 new candle.

    message: "*A) Definitions of the mechanical units which enter the definitions
      of electric units:* +\n  \n\n*Unit of force* - The unit of force [in the MKS
      (metre, kilogram, second) system] is the force which gives to a mass of 1 kilogram
      an acceleration of 1 metre per second, per second.\n\n*Joule* (unit of energy
      or work) - The joule is the work done when the point of application of 1 MKS
      unit of force [newton] moves a distance of 1 metre in the direction of the force.\n\n*Watt*
      (unit of power) - The watt is the power which in one second gives rise to energy
      of 1 joule.\n\n +\n*B) Definitions of electric units:* +\n  \n\nThe Comité International
      des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) accepts the following propositions which define
      the theoretical value of the electric units:\n\n*Ampere* (unit of electric current)
      - The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel
      conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed
      1 metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal
      to stem:[2 * 10^(-7)] MKS unit of force [newton] per metre of length.\n\n*Volt*
      (unit of potential difference and of electromotive force) - The volt is the
      potential difference between two points of a conducting wire carrying a constant
      current of 1 ampere, when the power dissipated between these points is equal
      to 1 watt.\n\n*Ohm* (unit of electric resistance) - The ohm is the electric
      resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference
      of 1 volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of 1
      ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.\n\n*Coulomb*
      (unit of quantity of electricity) - The coulomb is the quantity of electricity
      carried in 1 second by a current of 1 ampere.\n\n*Farad* (unit of capacitance)
      - The farad is the capacitance of a capacitor between the plates of which there
      appears a potential difference of 1 volt when it is charged by a quantity of
      electricity of 1 coulomb.\n\n*Henry* (unit of electric inductance) - The henry
      is the inductance of a closed circuit in which an electromotive force of 1 volt
      is produced when the electric current in the circuit varies uniformly at the
      rate of 1 ampere per second.\n\n*Weber* (unit of magnetic flux) - The weber
      is the magnetic flux which, linking a circuit of one turn, would produce in
      it an electromotive force of 1 volt if it were reduced to zero at a uniform
      rate in 1 second."

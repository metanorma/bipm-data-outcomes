  considerations:
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2001-10-12'
    message: considering that the natural logarithm is used for expressing the values
      of logarithmic decrement, field level and power level in the system of quantities
      on which the International System (SI) is based,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2001-10-12'
    message: considering that quantities and quantity equations become simplified
      when the natural logarithm (logarithm to the base e) is used, rather than logarithms
      to other bases,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2001-10-12'
    message: considering that in particular, for complex quantities the only useful
      logarithm is the natural logarithm,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2001-10-12'
    message: considering that with the use of the natural logarithm for complex quantities,
      the radian and neper become analogous units and should thus be given the same
      status in the SI,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2001-10-12'
    message: considering that the 20th General Conference (1995, Resolution 8), decided
      to interpret the then supplementary units in the SI, namely the radian and steradian,
      as dimensionless derived units and consequently to eliminate the class of supplementary
      units as a separate class in the SI,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2001-10-12'
    message: considering that the International Committee, through the SI brochure,
      7th edition (1998), has accepted for use with the SI the neper, symbol Np, as
      a special name for the coherent SI unit number one, for expressing the values
      of logarithmic quantities defined using natural logarithms, and also the noncoherent
      unit, the bel, symbol B, as a unit for expressing the values of logarithmic
      quantities defined using logarithms to the base ten, and has emphasized the
      importance of stating the reference level,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2001-10-12'
    message: "considering that there is a need to complete the internal consistency
      of the SI by formally adopting the special name neper with symbol Np for the
      coherent SI unit \x93one\x94, for expressing the values of logarithmic quantities
      in areas such as signal decay, electrotechnology, and acoustics,"

      use with the SI the unit bel, symbol B, and its commonly used submultiple the
      decibel, symbol dB, when using logarithms to the base ten, and"

    message: "*recommends* that the special name neper with symbol Np be adopted for
      the number one as the SI dimensionless derived unit for expressing the values

      The CIPM approved in 2001 the following proposal of the CCU regarding "SI units" and "units of the SI":

      * * *

      We suggest that "SI units" and "units of the SI" should be regarded as names that include both the base units and the coherent derived units, and also all units obtained by combining these with the recommended multiple and sub-multiple prefixes.

      We suggest that the name "coherent SI units" should be used when it is desired to restrict the meaning to only the base units and the coherent derived units.

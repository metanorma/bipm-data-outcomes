      declares

      . the base units, the supplementary units and the derived units of the Système International d'Unités, which form a coherent set, are denoted by the name "SI units";
      . the prefixes adopted by the CGPM for the formation of decimal multiples and submultiples of SI units are called "SI prefixes";

      and *recommends*

      . the use of SI units and of their decimal multiples and submultiples whose names are formed by means of SI prefixes.

      Note: The name "supplementary units", appearing in cgpm-resolution:en/11/12[Resolution 12] of the 11th CGPM (and in the present Recommendation) is given to SI units for which the General Conference declines to state whether they are base units or derived units.

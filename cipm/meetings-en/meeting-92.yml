    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: considering that improved frequency values for radiations of some high-stability
      cold ion standards already documented in the recommended radiations list have
      recently become available;
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: considering that improved frequency values for the infra-red gas-cell-based
      optical frequency standard in the optical telecommunications region, already
      documented in the recommended radiations list, have been determined;
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: considering that femtosecond comb-based frequency measurements for certain
      iodine gas-cell standards on the subsidiary recommended source list have recently
      been made for the first time, leading to significantly reduced uncertainty;

    message: |-
      *proposes* that the _recommended radiation_ list be revised to include the following:

      * updated frequency values for the single trapped ^stem:[88^(Sr)]+^ ion quadrupole transition and the single trapped ^stem:[171^(Yb)]+^ octupole transition;
      * an updated frequency value for the stem:["C"_(2)"H"_(2)]-stabilized standard at 1.54 µm;
      * updated frequency values for the I~2~-stabilized standards at 543 nm and 515 nm.

  title: Symbol for the decimal marker in the International System of Units (SI)

  approvals:
  - message: The International Committee for Weights and Measures,
  considerations:
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: considering that a principal purpose of the International System of Units
      (SI) is to enable values of quantities to be expressed in a manner that can
      be readily understood throughout the world,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: considering that values of quantities are normally expressed as a number
      times a unit,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: considering that often the number in the expression of the value of a
      quantity contains multiple digits with an integral part and a decimal part,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: considering that in Resolution 7 of the 9th General Conference, 1948,
      it is stated that “In numbers, the comma (French practice) or the dot (British
      practice) is used only to separate the integral part of numbers from the decimal
      part”,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: considering that following a decision of the International Committee
      made at its 86th meeting (1997), the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
      now uses the dot (point on the line) as the decimal marker in all English language
      versions, including the English text of the SI Brochure (the definitive international
      reference on the SI), with the comma (on the line) remaining the decimal marker
      in all of its French language publications,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: considering that nevertheless, some international bodies use the comma
      on the line as the decimal marker in their English language documents,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: considering that furthermore, some international bodies, including some
      international standards organizations, specify the decimal marker to be the
      comma on the line in all languages,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: considering that the prescription of the comma on the line as the decimal
      marker in many languages is in conflict with the customary usage of the point
      on the line as the decimal marker in those languages,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: considering that in some languages that are native to more than one country,
      either the point on the line or the comma on the line is used as the decimal
      marker depending on the country, while in some countries with more than one
      native language, either the point on the line or comma on the line is used depending
      on the language,
  - type: reaffirming
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: reaffirms that “Numbers may be divided in groups of three in order to
      facilitate reading; neither dots nor commas are ever inserted in the spaces
      between groups”, as stated in Resolution 7 of the 9th CGPM, 1948.
  actions:
  - type: declares
    date_effective: '2003-10-10'
    message: declares that the SI symbol for the decimal marker shall be either the
      point on the line or the comma on the line,

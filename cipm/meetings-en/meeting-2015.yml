      *considering*

      * the good uniformity of world-wide mass measurements of NMIs in CCM.M-K4 (key comparison of stem:[1 "kg"] stainless steel standards),
      * that CMCs for mass calibrations at the level of stem:[1 "kg"] range from 28 µg to 1850 µg,
      * that determinations of the Planck constant will provide the basis for the future definition of the kilogram after the introduction of the “new SI”,
      * that an extraordinary calibration using the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK) took place at BIPM from January 2014 to January 2015,
      * that the as-maintained BIPM mass unit (traceable to the IPK at the 3rd Periodic Verification (3rd PV) 1988-1992) had changed over 22 years by 35 µg,
      * that a mathematical model established by BIPM was able to explain this change between the 3rd PV and 2014,
      * that the BIPM will update calibration certificates issued between 1.1.2003 and 31.12.2013 for calibrations of stem:[1 "kg"] mass standards,

      decides

      * that the published results of key comparisons carried out by the CCM will not be corrected, and that the WGD-kg will advise the RMOs about how degrees of equivalence may be linked in a way that maintains consistency,
  actions:
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2015-03-10'
    message: recommends that determinations of the Planck constant shall be updated
      based on the corrections provided by the BIPM to the NMIs concerned,
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2015-03-10'
    message: recommends that NMIs receiving updated calibration certificates from
      the BIPM should take appropriate action as regards the need to inform their
      customers and the correction of calibration certificates affected, and should
      take the updated mass values as the basis for their future calibrations.

      *recommends*

      that the following transition frequencies shall be updated in the list of recommended values of standard frequencies:

      * the unperturbed optical transition 6s^2^ ^1^S~0~ - 6s6p ^3^P~0~ of the ^199^Hg neutral atom with a frequency of stem:[f]~199Hg~ = stem:[1 128 575 290 808 154.8 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[6 * 10^(-16)];
      * the unperturbed optical transition 6s ^2^S~½~ - 4f^13^ 6s^2 2^stem:["F"]~7/2~ of the ^stem:[171^(Yb)]+^ ion with a frequency of f171Yb+ (octupole) = stem:[642 121 496 772 645.0 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[6 * 10^(-16)] (this radiation is already endorsed by the CIPM as a secondary representation of the second);
      * the unperturbed optical transition 6s ^2^S~½~ (stem:[F = 0], stem:[m_("F") = 0]) - 5d 2D3/2 (stem:["F" = 2], stem:["mF" = 0]) of the 171Yb^+^ f171Yb+ (quadrupole) = stem:[688 358 979 309 308.3 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[6 * 10^(-16)] (this radiation is already endorsed by the CIPM as a secondary representation of the second);
      * the unperturbed optical transition 5s ^2^S~½~ - 4d ^2^D~5/2~ of the ^stem:[88^(Sr)]+^ ion with a frequency of stem:[f]~88Sr+~ = stem:[444 779 044 095 486.6 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.6 * 10^(-15)] (this radiation is already endorsed by the CIPM as a secondary representation of the second);
      * the unperturbed optical transition 4s ^2^S~½~ - 3d ^2^D~5/2~ of the ^stem:[40^(Ca)]+^ ion with a frequency of stem:[f]~40Ca+~ = stem:[411 042 129 776 398.4 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of 1.2 × 10^-14;^
      * the unperturbed optical transition 1S - 2S of the 1H neutral atom with a frequency of stem:[f_(1H)] = 1 stem:[233 030 706 593 514 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[9 * 10^(-15)].

      Note: This frequency corresponds to half of the energy difference between the 1S and 2S states;

      * the unperturbed optical transition 5s^2 1^S ~0~ - 5s5p ^3^P ~0~ of the ^87^Sr neutral atom with a frequency of stem:[f_(87Sr) = 429 228 004 229 873.2 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[5 * 10^(-16)] (this radiation is already endorsed by the CIPM as a secondary representation of the second);
      * the unperturbed optical transition 6s^2 1^S~0~ - 6s6p ^3^P~0~ of the ^171^Yb neutral atom with a frequency of stem:[f]~171Yb~ = stem:[518 295 836 590 864.0 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[2 * 10^(-15)] (this radiation is already endorsed by the CIPM as a secondary representation of the second);
      * the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition of ^87^Rb with a frequency of stem:[f_(87Rb)] = 6 834 682 stem:[610.904 310 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[7 * 10^(-16)] (this radiation is already endorsed by the CIPM as a secondary representation of the second).

      and also *recommends*

      that the following transition frequencies shall be included in the list of recommended values of standard frequencies:

      * Absorbing molecule ^127^I~2~, saturated absorption a~1~ component, R(36) 32-0 transition.

      The values

      |===
      | stem:[f_(a1) = 564 074 632.42 "MHz"]

      | _Î»_~a1~ = 531 476 582.65 fm

       with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1 * 10^(-10)] apply to the radiation of a frequency-doubled diode DFB laser, stabilized with an iodine cell external to the laser.

       +
      * Absorbing atom ^87^Rb 5S~1/2~ - 5P~3/2~ crossover between the d and f hyperfine components of the saturated absorption at 780 nm (D2 transition)

      The values

      |===
      | stem:[f]~d/f crossover~ = stem:[384 227 981.9 "MHz"]

      | Î»~d/f crossover~ = 780 246 291.6 fm

      |===

      +
       with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[5 * 10^(-10)] apply to the radiation of a tunable External Cavity Diode Laser, stabilized to the d/f crossover in a rubidium cell external to the laser.

      Note: The value of the standard uncertainty is assumed to correspond to a confidence level of 68 %. However, given the limited availability of data there is a possibility that in hindsight this might not prove to be exact.

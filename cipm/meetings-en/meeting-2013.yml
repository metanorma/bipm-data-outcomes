      *recommends* the following changes to the list of “Recommended values of standard frequencies for applications including the practical realization of the metre and secondary representations of the second”:

      * that the following transition frequency be added to the list:
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 6s^2^ ^1^S~0~ - 6s 6p ^3^P~0~ of the ^199^ Hg neutral atom with a frequency of stem:[1 128 575 290 808 162 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of 1.7  × stem:[10^(-14)];

      * that the following transition frequencies be updated in the list:
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 4s ^2^S~1/2~ - 3d ^2^D~5/2~ of the ^stem:[40^(Ca)]+^ ion with a frequency of 411 stem:[042 129 776 395 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of 1.5  × stem:[10^(-14)];
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 1S - 2S of the stem:[""_(1) "H"] neutral atom with a frequency of 1 233 stem:[030 706 593 518 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.2 * 10^(-14)];

      Note: This frequency corresponds to half of the energy difference between the 1S and 2S states;

      * that the following transition frequencies be updated in the list and endorsed as secondary representations of the second:
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 6s ^2^S~1/2~ - 4f ^stem:[13^(6s)2]^ ^2^stem:["F"]~7/2~ of the ^stem:[171^(Yb)]+^ ion (octupole) with a frequency of stem:[642 121 496 772 645.6 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.3 * 10^(-15)];
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 6s^2^ ^1^S~0~ - 6s 6p ^3^P~0~ of the ^171^Yb neutral atom with a frequency of stem:[518 295 836 590 865.0 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[2.7 * 10^(-15)];
      * that the following transition frequency be added to the list and as a secondary representation of the second:
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 3s^2^ ^1^S~0~ - 3s 3p ^3^P~0~ of the ^stem:[27^(Al)]+^ ion with a frequency of 1 stem:[121 015 393 207 857.3 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.9 * 10^(-15)];
      * that the following transition frequencies be updated in the list and as secondary representations of the second:
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 5d ^10^6s ^2^S~1/2~ - 5d ^stem:[9^(6s)2]^ ^2^D~5/2~ of the ^stem:[199^(Hg)]+^ ion with a frequency of stem:[1 064 721 609 899 145.3 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.9 * 10^(-15)];
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 6s ^2^S~1/2~ (stem:[F = 0], stem:[m_("F") = 0]) - 5d ^2^D~3/2~ (stem:[F = 2], stem:[m_("F") = 0]) of the ^stem:[171^(Yb)]+^ ion (quadrupole) with a frequency of stem:[688 358 979 309 307.1 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[3 * 10^(-15)];
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 5s ^2^S~1/2~ - 4d ^2^D~5/2~ of the ^stem:[88^(Sr)]+^ ion with a frequency of 444 stem:[779 044 095 485.3 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[4.0 * 10^(-15)];
      ** the unperturbed optical transition 5s^2^ ^1^S~0~ - 5s5p ^3^P~0~ of the ^87^Sr neutral atom with a frequency of stem:[429 228 004 229 873.4 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1 * 10^(-15)];
      * that the following transition frequency be updated as a secondary representation of the second:
      ** the unperturbed ground - state hyperfine transition of ^87^Rb with a frequency of 6 834 682 stem:[610.904 312 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[1.3 * 10^(-15)].

      Note: The value of the estimated standard uncertainty is assumed to correspond to a confidence level of 68 %. However, given the very limited number of available data there is a possibility that in hindsight this might not prove to be exact.

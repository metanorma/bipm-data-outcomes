      _recommends_ that, in any site, for such operations in support of International Atomic Time (TAI) :

      * the reference coordinates of the antenna should correspond to its real position in the terrestrial reference frame of the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS),
      * the reference coordinates and the operational coordinates used within the receiver should be reported to the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and collaborating laboratories,
      * neither the operational coordinates nor the location of the antenna should be subject to change without pressing cause,
      * if such a change is, however, found to be necessary, data sufficient to main tain the accuracy of the time comparisons should be passed without delay to the BIPM and the collaborating laboratories.

    message: |-
      acting in accordance with Resolution 7 of the 18th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (1987) has adopted the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) to supersede the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68).

      The CIPM *notes* that, by comparison with the IPTS-68, the ITS-90

      * extends to lower temperatures, down to stem:[0.65 "K"], and hence also supersedes the EPT 76,
      * is in substantially better agreement with corresponding thermodynamic temperatures,
      * has much improved continuity, precision and reproducibility throughout its range and
      * has subranges and alternative definitions in certain ranges which greatly facilitate its use.

      The CIPM also *notes* that, to accompany the text of the ITS-90 there will be two further documents, the _Supplementary Information for the ITS-90_ and _Techniques for Approximating the ITS-90_. These documents will be published by the BIPM and periodically updated.

      The CIPM *recommends*

      * that on 1 January 1990 the ITS-90 come into force and
      * that from this same date the IPTS-68 and the EPT-76 be abrogated.

    message: "*declares* that the standard to be employed is the transition between
      the hyperfine levels stem:[F = 4], stem:[M = 0] and stem:[F = 3], stem:[M =
      0] of the ground state ^2^S~1/2~ of the caesium-133 atom, unperturbed by external
      fields, and that the frequency of this transition is assigned the value 9 182
      631 770 hertz."

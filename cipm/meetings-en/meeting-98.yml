      *noting* that

      one of the key factors that led to the creation of the Metre Convention and the BIPM was the recommendation of the Second International Conference on Geodesy for the Measurement of Degrees in Europe, held in Berlin in 1867, that a European International Bureau of Weights and Measures be set up in order to unify European geodesy standards;

      *recommends* that

      the necessary steps be taken such that the ITRS, as defined by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) and realized by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) and International GNSS Service (IGS), be adopted by the General Conference on Weights and Measures as the international standard for terrestrial reference frames used for all metrological applications.

      *considering*

      * the good uniformity of world-wide mass measurements of NMIs in CCM.M-K4 (key comparison of stem:[1 "kg"] stainless steel standards),
      * that CMCs for mass calibrations at the level of stem:[1 "kg"] range from 28 µg to 1850 µg,
      * that determinations of the Planck constant will provide the basis for the future definition of the kilogram after the introduction of the “new SI”,
      * that an extraordinary calibration using the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK) took place at BIPM from January 2014 to January 2015,
      * that the as-maintained BIPM mass unit (traceable to the IPK at the 3rd Periodic Verification (3rd PV) 1988-1992) had changed over 22 years by 35 µg,
      * that a mathematical model established by BIPM was able to explain this change between the 3rd PV and 2014,
      * that the BIPM will update calibration certificates issued between 1.1.2003 and 31.12.2013 for calibrations of stem:[1 "kg"] mass standards,

      decides

      * that the published results of key comparisons carried out by the CCM will not be corrected, and that the WGD-kg will advise the RMOs about how degrees of equivalence may be linked in a way that maintains consistency,

      the BIPM should take appropriate action as regards the need to inform their
      customers and the correction of calibration certificates affected, and should
      take the updated mass values as the basis for their future calibrations.

      that the following transition frequencies shall be updated in the list of recommended values of standard frequencies:

      * the unperturbed optical transition 6s^2^ ^1^S~0~ - 6s6p ^3^P~0~ of the ^199^Hg neutral atom with a frequency of stem:[f]~199Hg~ = stem:[1 128 575 290 808 154.8 "Hz"] and an estimated relative standard uncertainty of stem:[6 * 10^(-16)];

      and also *recommends*

      that the following transition frequencies shall be included in the list of recommended values of standard frequencies:

      * Absorbing molecule ^127^I~2~, saturated absorption a~1~ component, R(36) 32-0 transition.

      * Absorbing atom ^87^Rb 5S~1/2~ - 5P~3/2~ crossover between the d and f hyperfine components of the saturated absorption at 780 nm (D2 transition)

      Note: The value of the standard uncertainty is assumed to correspond to a confidence level of 68 %. However, given the limited availability of data there is a possibility that in hindsight this might not prove to be exact.

    message: decided to defer the discussion on the BIPM terminology agenda item until
      its next meeting. It established a small working group composed of J. McLaren
      (Chair), J. Ullrich, W. Louw and M. Milton to review the issue and to report
      back to at its next meeting.

      adopted the traceability exception related to delta value isotope ratio measurements proposed by the CCQM as follows:

      "Delta value isotope ratio measurements that cannot presently be made traceable to the SI should be made traceable to materials\* recognised as International Standards. Since at present, values assigned to these materials are based on consensus values, these materials are not listed in the Appendix stem:["C"] of the BIPM Database.

      \* stem:["A"] list of certified reference materials that should be used to identify accepted references for delta value isotope ratio traceability statements is published and maintained by IUPAC:

      Willi A. Brand, Tyler B. Coplen, Jochen Vogl, Martin Rosner and Thomas Prohaska

      Assessment of international reference materials for isotope-ratio analysis (IUPAC Technical Report). Pure Appl. Chem. 2014; 86(3): 425-467

      The report is available for free download: http://www.degruyter.com/doi/10.1515/pac-2013-1023[http://www.degruyter.com/doi/10.1515/pac-2013-1023]

      The CIPM notes that assigned values for replacement materials should be done through a formal internationally vetted procedure that assures the continued comparability of delta value measurements.

      The CIPM encourages the continuation of programmes within the NMIs to develop absolute isotope ratio measurement values for such Reference Materials and active engagement with the IUPAC community."

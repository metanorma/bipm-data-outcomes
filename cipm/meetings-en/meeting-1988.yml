    date_effective: '1988-01-01'
    message: considering that a detailed study of the results of the most recent determinations
      leads to a value of stem:[483 597.9 "GHz"/"V"] for the Josephson constant, stem:[K_("J")],
      that is to say, for the quotient of frequency divided by the potential difference
      corresponding to the stem:[n = 1] step in the Josephson effect,

    date_effective: '1988-01-01'
    message: considering that the Josephson effect, together with this value of stem:[K_("J")],
      can be used to establish a reference standard of electromotive force having
      a one-standard-deviation uncertainty with respect to the volt estimated to be
      4 parts in stem:[10^(7)], and a reproducibility which is significantly better,

    date_effective: '1988-01-01'
    message: draws the attention of laboratories to the fact that the new value is
      greater by stem:[3.9 "GHz"/"V"], or about 8 parts in stem:[10^(6)], than the
      value given in 1972 by the Comité Consultatif d'Électricité in its Declaration
      E-72.

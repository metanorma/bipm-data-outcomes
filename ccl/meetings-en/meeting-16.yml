      *considering* that

      a common list of “Recommended values of standard frequencies for applications including the practical realization of the metre and secondary representations of the second” has been established;

      the CCL-CCTF Frequency Standards Working Group (WGFS) has reviewed several candidates for updating the list;

      *recommends*

      that the following transition frequencies shall be included in the list of recommended values of standard frequencies:

      * Absorbing molecule ^127^I~2~, saturated absorption a~1~ component, R(36)32-0 transition. +
       +
       The values +
      stem:[f_(a1) = 564 074 632.42 "MHz"] +
       +
      _λ_~stem:[ alpha 1]~ = 531 476 582.65 fm +
       +
       with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of 1 × 10^−10^ apply to the radiation of a frequency-doubled diode DFB laser, stabilized with an iodine cell external to the laser.
       +
      * Absorbing atom ^87^Rb crossover between the d and f hyperfine components of the saturated absorption at 780 nm (D2 transition) +
       +
       The values +
      stem:[f]~d/f crossover~ = stem:[384 227 981.9 "MHz"] +
       +
      _λ_~d/f crossover~ = 780 246 291.6 fm +
       +
       with an estimated relative standard uncertainty of 5 × 10^−10^ apply to the radiation of a tunable External Cavity Diode Laser, stabilized using the 3rd derivative technique.

      Note: The value of the standard uncertainty is assumed to correspond to a confidence level of 68 %. However, given the very limited number of available data there is a possibility that in hindsight this might not prove to be exact.

      . a continuous reference time scale corresponds to UTC without leap second discontinuities;
      . the concepts of continuity and uniformity should be applied strictly in a reference time scale;
      . the unit for any quantity in metrology is unique, and as such, a single time scale should also be unique;
      . in the event of a redefinition of any quantity in metrology, the unit should be invariant, and particularly for the second of the Système International the respective scale should be continuous and uniform;
      . the name “Coordinated Universal Time” be maintained in the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap second adjustments;
      . the term “Universal” in “Coordinated Universal Time” implies that the time scale is to be used throughout the world;
      . the term “Coordinated” in “Coordinated Universal Time” implies coordination among National Metrology Institutes and not a relationship to the direction of the Sun from a position on the surface of the Earth;
      . the angle UT1 used to relate celestial and terrestrial reference systems should not be considered as a time scale, but as the angle that characterizes the variable rotation of the Earth;
      . the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) provides a means of accessing UT1 in real-time by means of routinely available predictions of UT1-UTC with precision 100 000 times better that the coarse approximation UT1 = UTC currently provided by means of coding UTC to match UT1 within 0.9 second;

      Representations of the Second in its meeting at the BIPM on 30 March 2004 discussed
      possible candidates to be included in the list for secondary representations
      of the second,

    message: "*and recognizes that* several optical frequency standards have been
      reviewed by the JWG. Although none has been proposed at this stage, the JWG
      believes that the rapid progress with these optical frequency standards requires
      that they should again be reviewed at its next meeting for their possible use
      as secondary representations of the second."

      is essential to ensure a correct estimation of the scale unit of International
      Atomic Time (TAI),
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2004-04-02'

      and made available publicly,
  actions:
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2004-04-02'
    message: recommends that laboratories that develop primary frequency standards
      operate them on a regular basis to realize the SI second and provide to the
      International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) results of comparisons of
      the primary frequency standard with a clock contributing to TAI,
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2004-04-02'
    message: recommends that the uncertainty statements of each primary standard either
      refer to the publication of all corrections, their methods of evaluation and
      descriptions of all instrumentation, or itself constitute such a publication
      [Recommendation S 3 (1999)],
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2004-04-02'

    date_effective: '2004-04-02'
    message: recommends that the procedure of TAI frequency steering be adapted with
      the aim of ensuring that the estimation of the TAI scale unit conforms to its
      definition within 3 σ uncertainty,
  - type: recommends

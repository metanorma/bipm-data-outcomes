  approvals:
  - message: The Consultative Committee for Electricity and Magnetism (CCEM),
  considerations:
  - type: having / having regard
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: "*having reviewed* different possible changes to the SI and having considered
      the associated merits of each by consulting with electrical metrologists, industrial
      users and others in the metrology community,"
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: considering that defining units in terms of the fundamental constants,
      specifically the elementary charge, stem:[e], and the Planck constant, stem:[h],
      ensures their long-term stability and consistency,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: considering that combinations of the elementary charge stem:[e] and the
      Planck constant stem:["h"] are fundamental quantities in quantum phenomena in
      electricity and magnetism,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: considering that macroscopic quantum effects exist which link the fundamental
      constants stem:[e] and stem:[h] to macroscopic observables,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: considering that the representation of the volt using the Josephson effect
      and the conventional value of the Josephson constant, stem:[K_(J-90)], and the
      representation of the ohm using the quantum Hall effect and the conventional
      value of the von Klitzing constant, stem:[R_(K-90)], have provided practical,
      accessible, reproducible, low noise and highly linear references world-wide
      since 1990,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: considering that the 1990 representations of the volt and the ohm, while
      in daily use world-wide, are not SI units and that by implementing the changes
      in the SI recommended below, the use of the Josephson effect and quantum Hall
      effect would allow direct SI realizations of voltage and resistance and thus
      provide long term stability and accuracy to the electrical units within the
      SI,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: considering that the theory, reproducibility, and independence of experimental
      realizations of the Josephson and quantum Hall effects are well established,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: considering that the Josephson and quantum Hall effects are directly
      related to fundamental constants as evidenced by coherence with other high precision
      measurements and that this coherence is such that there is no evidence to suggest
      that the usual expressions describing these effects are incorrect,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: considering that consistency among electrical measurements has been greatly
      improved since the introduction of the representations of the volt and the ohm
      by the Josephson effect and the quantum Hall effect,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: considering that the use of these quantum-based standards will continue
      for the foreseeable future,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: considering that improvements in the technology associated with the Josephson
      and quantum Hall effects, as well as quantized charge transport, are continuing,
      making these references even more accurate, easier to operate and more versatile,
  - type: recognizing
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: "*recognizing* that adoption of fixed values of stem:[e] and stem:[h]
      may introduce a small, but acceptable, single discontinuity in the results of
      electrical measurements at the time that the redefinition is implemented,"
  actions:
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: recommends that the SI be changed by adopting fixed values of the elementary
      charge stem:[e] and Planck constant stem:[h], and that this decision be taken
      in the near future, for example in 2011, provided that adequate agreement is
      achieved among independent experiments,
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: recommends that the National Metrology Institutes be strongly encouraged
      to support relevant research in order to implement the changes recommended here
      and to improve our knowledge of the relevant science thereby providing and maintaining
      the most consistent SI possible,
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: recommends that the values of the elementary charge stem:[e] and the
      Planck constant stem:[h], be fixed at the values most recently published by
      CODATA preceding the adoption of these changes to the SI, but rounded and given
      without associated uncertainties,
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: recommends that the definitions of the electrical units and their _mises
      en pratique_ be revised to reflect this change, and that the CCEM be involved
      in this process,
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: recommends that if the concept of base units is retained then the ampere
      be kept as a base unit for the purposes of historical continuity and SI dimensional
      analysis although there is no preferential order of traceability within the
      electrical units,
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: 'recommends that the ampere be defined, for example, as follows: “The
      ampere is the electrical current equivalent to the flow of exactly 1/(1.602
      176 53 × 10^−19^) elementary charges per second.” (It follows that this definition
      fixes the elementary charge as exactly 1.602 176 53 × 10^−19^ stem:["A" * "s"]),'
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2007-03-16'
    message: recommends that this change in the SI be actively publicized and promoted
      to ensure its smooth introduction into the measurement community and that one
      year is the minimum time needed to prepare the general public for such a change
      in the SI.

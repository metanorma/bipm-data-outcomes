  reference_name: Proceedings of the 24th CCEM (2005), 2005
  reference_page: 26
  approvals:
  - message: The Consultative Committee for Electricity and Magnetism (CCEM),
  considerations:
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2005-03-18'
    message: considering the recent proposal to redefine the kilogram in terms of
      a fixed value for either the Planck constant or the Avogadro constant at the
      23rd General Conference in 2007,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2005-03-18'
    message: considering that the realization of a definition of the kilogram in these
      terms necessarily requires the permanent availability of experiments that relate
      mass to fundamental constants,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2005-03-18'
    message: considering the advantages that such a redefinition would bring to the
      scientific community through the significant reduction in the uncertainties
      of the SI values of many fundamental constants,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2005-03-18'
    message: considering that a redefinition with a fixed value for the Planck constant,
      if combined with a redefinition of the ampere fixing the value of the elementary
      charge, would have further benefits for the scientific community, particularly
      in electrical metrology,
  - type: recalling / further recalling
    date_effective: '2005-03-18'
    message: "*recalling* Resolution 7 of the 21st General Conference (1999), which
      recommended that national laboratories continue their efforts to refine experiments
      that link the unit of mass to fundamental or atomic constants with a view to
      a future redefinition of the kilogram,"
  - type: noting
    date_effective: '2005-03-18'
    message: noting the existing discrepancy of about 1 part in stem:[10^(6)] between
      the results from watt balance and x-ray crystal density measurements,
  - type: noting
    date_effective: '2005-03-18'
    message: noting the fact that this discrepancy is significant at the practical
      level and is unlikely to be resolved by 2007,
  actions:
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2005-03-18'
    message: recommends that any decision on redefining the kilogram be deferred until
      the 24th General Conference in 2011,
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2005-03-18'
    message: recommends that laboratories continue to make their best efforts to produce
      data for the 2010 CODATA adjustment of the values of the fundamental constants
      to support a possible redefinition of the kilogram at the 24th General Conference,
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '2005-03-18'
    message: recommends that at that time, consideration be given to fixing the values
      of both the Planck constant and the elementary charge.

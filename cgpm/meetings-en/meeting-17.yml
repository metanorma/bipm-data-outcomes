  considerations:
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1983-10-21'
    message: considering that the present definition does not allow a sufficiently
      precise realization of the metre for all requirements,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1983-10-21'
    message: considering that progress made in the stabilization of lasers allows
      radiations to be obtained that are more reproducible and easier to use than
      the standard radiation emitted by a krypton 86 lamp,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1983-10-21'
    message: considering that progress made in the measurement of the frequency and
      wavelength of these radiations has resulted in concordant determinations of
      the speed of light whose accuracy is limited principally by the realization
      of the present definition of the metre,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1983-10-21'
    message: considering that wavelengths determined from frequency measurements and
      a given value for the speed of light have a reproducibility superior to that
      which can be obtained by comparison with the wavelength of the standard radiation
      of krypton 86,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1983-10-21'
    message: considering that there is an advantage, notably for astronomy and geodesy,
      in maintaining unchanged the value of the speed of light recommended in 1975
      by the cgpm-resolution:en/15/2[15th CGPM in its Resolution 2] (stem:[c = 299
      792 458 "m"/"s"]),
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1983-10-21'
    message: considering that a new definition of the metre has been envisaged in
      various forms all of which have the effect of giving the speed of light an exact
      value, equal to the recommended value, and that this introduces no appreciable
      discontinuity into the unit of length, taking into account the relative uncertainty
      of stem:[ +-  4 * 10^(-9)] of the best realizations of the present definition
      of the metre,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1983-10-21'
    message: considering that these various forms, making reference either to the
      path travelled by light in a specified time interval or to the wavelength of
      a radiation of measured or specified frequency, have been the object of consultations
      and deep discussions, have been recognized as being equivalent and that a consensus
      has emerged in favour of the first form,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1983-10-21'
    message: considering that the Comité Consultatif pour la Définition du Mètre (CCDM)
      is now in a position to give instructions for the practical realization of such
      a definition, instructions which could include the use of the orange radiation
      of krypton 86 used as standard up to now, and which may in due course be extended
      or revised,
  actions:
  - type: decides
    date_effective: '1983-10-21'
    message: decides The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum
      during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.
  - type: decides
    date_effective: '1983-10-21'
    message: decides The definition of the metre in force since 1960, based upon the
      transition between the levels 2p~10~ and 5d~5~ of the atom of krypton 86, is
      abrogated.

      and *considering*

      * that the air-buoyancy correction is based upon the density of the ambient air,

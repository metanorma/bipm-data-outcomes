    message: considering that a principal purpose of the International System of Units
      (SI) is to enable values of quantities to be expressed in a manner that can
      be readily understood throughout the world,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-17'

      times a unit,

      quantity contains multiple digits with an integral part and a decimal part,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-17'
    message: considering that in Resolution 7 of the 9th General Conference, 1948,

      practice) is used only to separate the integral part of numbers from the decimal
      part",

    date_effective: '2003-10-17'
    message: considering that following a decision of the International Committee
      made at its 86th meeting (1997), the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
      now uses the dot (point on the line) as the decimal marker in all the English
      language versions of its publications, including the English text of the SI
      Brochure (the definitive international reference on the SI), with the comma
      (on the line) remaining the decimal marker in all of its French language publications,

    date_effective: '2003-10-17'
    message: considering that the prescription of the comma on the line as the decimal
      marker is in many languages in conflict with the customary usage of the point
      on the line as the decimal marker in those languages,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2003-10-17'
    message: considering that in some languages that are native to more than one country,
      either the point on the line or the comma on the line is used as the decimal
      marker depending on the country, while in some countries with more than one
      native language, either the point on the line or comma on the line is used depending
      on the language,

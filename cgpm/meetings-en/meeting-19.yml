    date_effective: '1991-10-03'
    message: recommends the construction of new primary caesium standards, the improvement
      of the frequency accuracy of existing primary standards and the study of the
      systematic differences in frequency which exist between them,
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '1991-10-03'
    message: recommends that the laboratories participating in International Atomic
      Time (TAI) stabilize the environmental conditions of each contributing clock,
      keep careful records of these environmental conditions and report them to the
      BIPM,
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '1991-10-03'
    message: recommends that the coordinates adopted for antennas used in single-way
      time comparison by satellite techniques correspond to their real position in
      the terrestrial reference system of the International Earth Rotation Service.

  considerations:
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1991-10-03'
    message: considering that worldwide uniformity and long-term stability of the
      national representations of electrical units are of great importance for science,
      industry and commerce for both technical and economic reasons,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1991-10-03'
    message: considering that many national laboratories now use the Josephson and
      quantum-Hall effects for the conservation of their representations of the volt
      and the ohm respectively, a practice giving complete security in terms of long-term
      stability,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '1991-10-03'
    message: considering that the values attributed to their representations should
      be in as close as possible agreement with the SI,

    date_effective: '1991-10-03'
    message: recalling cgpm-resolution:en/18/6[Resolution 6 of the 18th Conférence
      Générale] concerning adjustments then foreseen in representations of the volt
      and the ohm,
  - type: noting
    date_effective: '1991-10-03'
    message: noting the decisions made by the Comité International des Poids et Mesures
      in 1988, during its 77th Meeting concerning these adjustments, in particular
      the conventional values stem:[K_(J-90)] (equal to stem:[483 597","9 "GHz"/"V"])
      and stem:[R_(K-90)] (equal to stem:[25 812","807  sf Omega ]) attributed to
      the Josephson constant stem:[K_("J")] and the von Klitzing constant stem:[R_("K")]
      used in representations of the volt and the ohm respectively,
  actions:
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '1991-10-03'
    message: recommends that national laboratories continue their efforts to reduce
      the uncertainty in the knowledge of the ratios stem:[K_(J-90)/K_("J")] and stem:[R_(K-90)/R_("K")],
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '1991-10-03'
    message: recommends that research be continued into the basic theory of the Josephson
      and quantum-Hall effects.

    message: |-
      noting

       that the cgpm-resolution:en/18/7[18th Conférence Générale in its Resolution 7] had invited the Comité International des Poids et Mesures and national laboratories to prepare and adopt a new international scale to replace the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968, by then known to differ significantly from thermodynamic temperatures,
       that the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) adopted by the Comité International in 1989 at its 78th Meeting is generally more precise, more readily realized and more nearly in accord with thermodynamic temperatures, and that it fulfills the requirements demanded of it by Resolution 7 of the 18th Conférence Générale,
  actions:
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: '1991-10-03'
    message: recommends that national laboratories continue their efforts to improve
      the worldwide uniformity and long-term stability in the measurement of temperature
      by the rapid implementation of the ITS-90 and the maintenance of research programmes
      on fundamental thermometry.

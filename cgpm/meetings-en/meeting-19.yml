    message: considering that many national laboratories now use the Josephson and
      quantum-Hall effects for the conservation of their representations of the volt
      and the ohm respectively, a practice giving complete security in terms of long-term

      and stem:[R_(K-90)] (equal to 25 812,807 Ω) attributed to the Josephson constant

    message: noting that the 18th Conférence Générale in its Resolution 7 had invited
      the Comité International des Poids et Mesures and national laboratories to prepare
      and adopt a new international scale to replace the International Practical Temperature
      Scale of 1968, by then known to differ significantly from thermodynamic temperatures,

    message: noting that the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) adopted
      by the Comité International in 1989 at its 78th Meeting is generally more precise,
      more readily realized and more nearly in accord with thermodynamic temperatures,

  actions:
  - type: decides
    date_effective: '1991-10-04'
    message: "*decides* to add to the list of SI prefixes to be used for multiples
      and submultiples of units, adopted by the 11th CGPM, Resolution 12, paragraph
      3, the 12th CGPM, Resolution 8, and the 15th CGPM, Resolution 10, the following
      prefixes:\n\n|===\n.<| Multiplying factor .<| Prefix .<| Symbol\n\n3+| \n.<|
      stem:[10^(21)] .<| zetta .<| Z\n.<| stem:[10^(-21)] .<| zepto .<| z\n.<| stem:[10^(24)]
      .<| yotta .<| Y\n.<| stem:[10^(-24)] .<| yocto .<| y\n\n|==="
  notes: The names zepto and zetta are derived from septo suggesting the number seven
    (the seventh power of stem:[10^(3)]) and the letter "z" is substituted for the
    letter "s" to avoid the duplicate use of the letter "s" as a symbol. The names
    yocto and yotta are derived from octo, suggesting the number eight (the eight
    power of stem:[10^(3)]); the letter "y" is added to avoid the use of the letter
    "o" as a symbol because it may be confused with the number zero.

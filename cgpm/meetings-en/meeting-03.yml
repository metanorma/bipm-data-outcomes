    message: 'The Conference declares The word "weight" denotes a quantity of the
      same nature as a "force": the weight of a body is the product of its mass and
      the acceleration due to gravity; in particular, the standard weight of a body
      is the product of its mass and the standard acceleration due to gravity;'

    date_effective: '1901-10-22'
    message: The Conference declares The value adopted in the International Service
      of Weights and Measures for the standard acceleration due to gravity is stem:[980.665
      "cm"/"s"^(2)], value already stated in the laws of some countries.

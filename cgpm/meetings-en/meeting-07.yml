      the axes of the two central lines marked on the bar of platinum-iridium kept
      at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures and declared Prototype of the
      metre by the 1st Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures, this bar being subject
      to standard atmospheric pressure and supported on two cylinders of at least
      one centimetre diameter, symmetrically placed in the same horizontal plane at
      a distance of stem:[571 "mm"] from each other.

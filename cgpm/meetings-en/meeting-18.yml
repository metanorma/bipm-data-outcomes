      recalls that

       the definition of the second as it results from the decisions of the 13th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures implies that the caesium atom used as reference is at rest and unperturbed,
       this implies in particular that, in its practical realization, measurements must be corrected for the velocity of the caesium atoms with respect to the clock reference frame, for magnetic and electric interactions, spin exchange and other possible perturbations,

      and, in order to implement the necessary corrections,

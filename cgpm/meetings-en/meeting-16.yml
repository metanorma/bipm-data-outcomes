      1967, is abrogated.
  notes: |-
    Photopic vision is detected by the cones on the retina of the eye, which are sensitive to a high level of luminance (stem:[L] \> ca. stem:[10 "cd"/"m"^(2)]) and are used in daytime vision. Scotopic vision is detected by the rods of the retina, which are sensitive to low level luminance (stem:[L] \< ca. stem:[10^(-3) "cd"/"m"^(2)]), used in night vision. In the domain between these levels of luminance both cones and rods are used, and this is described as mesopic vision. +

     This definition of the candela was abrogated in 2018 by the 26th CGPM (Resolution 1), which became effective in 2019.

      *Appendix 3. The base units of the SI*

      Starting from the new definition of the SI described above in terms of fixed numerical values of the defining constants, definitions of each of the seven base units are deduced by taking, as appropriate, one or more of these defining constants to give the following set of definitions, effective from 20 May 2019:

      * The second, symbol stem:["s"], is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency stem:[ sf Delta  nu ]~Cs~, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit stem:["Hz"], which is equal to stem:["s"^(-1)].
      * The metre, symbol stem:["m"], is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum stem:[c] to be 299 792 458 when expressed in the unit stem:["m"/"s"], where the second is defined in terms of stem:[ sf Delta  nu ]~Cs~.
      * The kilogram, symbol stem:["kg"], is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant stem:[h] to be stem:[6.626 070 15 * 10^(-34)] when expressed in the unit stem:["J" * "s"], which is equal to stem:["kg" * "m"^(2) * "s"^(-1)], where the metre and the second are defined in terms of stem:[c] and stem:[ sf Delta  nu ]~Cs~.
      * The ampere, symbol stem:["A"], is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge stem:[e] to be stem:[1.602 176 634 * 10^(-19)] when expressed in the unit stem:["C"], which is equal to stem:["A" * "s"], where the second is defined in terms of stem:[ sf Delta  nu ]~Cs~.
      * The kelvin, symbol stem:["K"], is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant stem:[k] to be stem:[1.380 649 * 10^(-23)] when expressed in the unit stem:["J" * "K"^(-1)], which is equal to stem:["kg" * "m"^(2) * "s"^(-2) * "K"^(-1)], where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of stem:[h], stem:[c] and stem:[ sf Delta  nu ]~Cs~.
      * The mole, symbol stem:["mol"], is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole contains exactly stem:[6.022 140 76 * 10^(23)] elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, stem:[N_("A")], when expressed in the unit stem:["mol"^(-1)] and is called the Avogadro number. +
       The amount of substance, symbol stem:[n], of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles.
      * The candela, symbol stem:["cd"], is the SI unit of luminous intensity in a given direction. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency stem:[540 * 10^(12) "Hz"], stem:["K"_("cd")], to be 683 when expressed in the unit stem:["lm" * "W"^(-1)], which is equal to stem:["cd" * "sr" * "W"^(-1)], or stem:["cd" * "sr" * "kg"^(-1) * "m"^(-2) * "s"^(3)], where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of stem:[h], stem:[c] and stem:[ sf Delta  nu ]~Cs~.

      *recalling* that

      * Article 6 paragraphs 6 to 8 (1921) of the Regulations annexed to the Metre Convention reads as follows:
      **"_6. Si un État est demeuré trois années sans effectuer le versement de sa contribution, celle-ci est répartie entre les autres États, au prorata de leurs propres contributions. Les sommes supplémentaires, versées ainsi par les États pour parfaire le montant de la dotation du Bureau, sont considérées comme une avance faite à l'État retardataire, et leur sont remboursées si celui ci vient à acquitter ses contributions arriérées. +
       7. Les avantages et prérogatives conférés par l'adhésion à la Convention du Mètre sont suspendus à l'égard des États déficitaires de trois années. +
       8. Après trois nouvelles années, l'État déficitaire est exclu de la Convention, et le calcul des contributions est rétabli conformément aux dispositions de l’article 20 du présent Règlement._"^(1)^

      of paragraph 8 of Article 6 of the Annexed Regulations by not excluding Member
      States when they have defaulted on their contributions for more than six years
      and by not re-establishing the calculation of contributions,
  - type: noting
    date_effective: '2018-11-16'
    message: noting that historical practice has resulted in certain Member States
      remaining in a state of suspension for periods considerably exceeding the three-year
      period envisaged in the Annexed Regulations, leading to the accumulation of
      their arrears and the consequent distribution of their contributions among all
      other Member States,

    message: noting that Resolution 8 adopted by the CGPM at its 23rd meeting (2007)
      introduced a procedure for the exclusion of a defaulting Member State that requires
      a decision of the CGPM, and consequently, the period of suspension prior to
      exclusion depends on the scheduling of CGPM meetings and thus defaulting Member
      States may not be treated equally,

      translation for easy reference of the authoritative French version: +\n6. If
      a State remains three years without paying its contribution, the said contribution
      is distributed among the other States pro-rata to their own contributions. The
      supplementary sums thus paid by these States to make up the dotation of the
      Bureau are considered as advances made to the State in arrears, and are reimbursed
      to them in the event that it repays its arrears of contributions. +\n7. The
      advantages and prerogatives conferred by accession to the Metre Convention are
      suspended for those States in arrears by three years. +\n8. After three more
      years, the State in arrears is excluded from the Convention and the calculation

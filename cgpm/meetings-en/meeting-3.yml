      *The Conference declares*

      . The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram;
      . The word "weight" denotes a quantity of the same nature as a "force": the weight of a body is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity; in particular, the standard weight of a body is the product of its mass and the standard acceleration due to gravity;
      . The value adopted in the International Service of Weights and Measures for the standard acceleration due to gravity is stem:[980.665 "cm"/"s"]
      +
      ^2^
      +
      , value already stated in the laws of some countries.

  notes: This value of __g__~n~ was the conventional reference for calculating the
    now obsolete unit kilogram force.

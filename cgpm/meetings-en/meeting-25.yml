    message: recalling cgpm-resolution:en/24/1[Resolution 1] adopted by the CGPM at
      its 24th meeting (2011), which takes note of the intention of the International
      Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) to propose a revision of the SI that
      links the definitions of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and mole to exact numerical
      values of the Planck constant stem:[h], elementary charge stem:[e], Boltzmann
      constant stem:[k], and Avogadro constant stem:[N_("A")], respectively, and which
      revises the way the SI is defined including the wording of the definitions of
      the SI units for time, length, mass, electric current, thermodynamic temperature,
      amount of substance, and luminous intensity so that the reference constants
      on which the SI is based are clearly apparent,

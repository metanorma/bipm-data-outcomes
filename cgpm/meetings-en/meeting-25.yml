    message: recalling Resolution 1 adopted by the CGPM at its 24th meeting (2011),
      which takes note of the intention of the International Committee for Weights
      and Measures (CIPM) to propose a revision of the SI that links the definitions
      of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and mole to exact numerical values of thePlanck
      constant stem:[h], elementary charge stem:[e], Boltzmann constant stem:[k],
      and Avogadroconstant stem:[N_("A")], respectively, and which revises the way
      the SI is defined including the wording of the definitions of the SI units for
      time, length, mass, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance,
      and luminous intensity so that the reference constants on which the SI is basedare
      clearly apparent,

      potential benefits of a redefinition of a number of units of the International
      System of Units (SI),
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2011-10-21'
    message: considering that the national metrology institutes (NMIs) as well as
      the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) have rightfully expended
      significant effort during the last several decades to advance the International
      System of Units (SI) by extending the frontiers of metrology so that SI base
      units can be defined in terms of the invariants of nature - the fundamental
      physical constants or properties of atoms,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2011-10-21'
    message: considering that a prominent example of the success of such efforts is
      the current definition of the SI unit of length, the metre (17th meeting of
      the CGPM, 1983, Resolution 1), which links it to an exact value of the speed
      of light in vacuum stem:[c], namely, 299 792 458 metre per second,

    date_effective: '2011-10-21'
    message: considering that of the seven base units of the SI, only the kilogram
      is still defined in terms of a material artefact, namely, the international
      prototype of the kilogram (1st meeting of the CGPM, 1889, 3rd meeting of the
      CGPM, 1901), and that the definitions of the ampere, mole and candela depend
      on the kilogram,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2011-10-21'
    message: considering that although the international prototype has served science
      and technology well since it was sanctioned by the CGPM at its 1st meeting in
      1889, it has a number of important limitations, one of the most significant
      being that its mass is not explicitly linked to an invariant of nature and in
      consequence its long-term stability is not assured,
  - type: considering
    date_effective: '2011-10-21'
    message: considering that the CGPM at its 21st meeting in 1999 adopted Resolution
      7 in which it recommended that "national laboratories continue their efforts
      to refine experiments that link the unit of mass to fundamental or atomic constants
      with a view to a future redefinition of the kilogram",
  - type: considering

    message: considering that many advances have been made in recent years in relating
      the mass of the international prototype to the Planck constant stem:[h], by
      methods which include watt balances and measurements of the mass of a silicon
      atom,

      directly or indirectly by means of the Josephson and quantum Hall effects together
      with the SI values of the Josephson and von Klitzing constants stem:[K_("J")]

      so as to be linked to an exact numerical value of stem:[h], and if the ampere

    message: considering that it is also possible to redefine the mole so that it
      is linked to an exact numerical value of the Avogadro constant stem:[N_("A")],
      and is thus no longer dependent on the definition of the kilogram even when
      the kilogram is defined so that it is linked to an exact numerical value of
      stem:[h], thereby emphasizing the distinction between amount of substance and
      mass,

      values when expressed in SI units,

    message: considering that the General Conference, at its 23rd meeting in 2007,
      adopted Resolution 12 in which it outlined the work that should be carried out
      by the NMIs, the BIPM and the International Committee for Weights and Measures
      (CIPM) together with its Consultative Committees (CCs) so that new definitions
      of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and mole in terms of fundamental constants
      could be adopted,

    message: considering that, although this work has progressed well, not all the
      requirements set out in Resolution 12 adopted by the General Conference at its
      23rd meeting in 2007 have been satisfied and so the International Committee
      for Weights and Measures is not yet ready to make a final proposal,

    message: |-
      *takes note* of the intention of the International Committee for Weights and Measures to propose a revision of the SI as follows:

      * the International System of Units, the SI, will be the system of units in which:
      ** the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom stem:[ sf Delta  nu (""_(133) "Cs")_("hfs")] is exactly 9 192 631 770 hertz,
      ** the speed of light in vacuum stem:[c] is exactly 299 792 458 metre per second,
      ** the Planck constant stem:[h] is exactly 6.626 06X × 10^−34^ joule second,
      ** the elementary charge stem:[e] is exactly 1.602 17X × 10^−19^ coulomb,
      ** the Boltzmann constant stem:[k] is exactly 1.380 6X × 10^−23^ joule per kelvin,
      ** the Avogadro constant stem:[N_("A")] is exactly 6.022 14 X × stem:[10^(23)] reciprocal mole,
      ** the luminous efficacy stem:[K_("cd")] of monochromatic radiation of frequency stem:[540 * 10^(12) "Hz"] is exactly 683 lumen per watt,

      where

      .. the hertz, joule, coulomb, lumen, and watt, with unit symbols stem:["Hz"], stem:["J"], stem:["C"], stem:["lm"], and stem:["W"], respectively, are related to the units second, metre, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela, with unit symbols stem:["s"], stem:["m"], stem:["kg"], stem:["A"], stem:["K"], stem:["mol"], and stem:["cd"], respectively, according to stem:["Hz" = "s"]^−1^, stem:["J" = "m"^(2) * "kg" * "s"]^−2^, stem:["C" = "s" * "A"], stem:["lm" = "cd" * "m"^(2) * "m"]^−2^ = stem:["cd" * "sr"], and stem:["W" = "m"^(2) * "kg" * "s"]^−3^,
      .. the symbol X in this Draft Resolution represents one or more additional digits to be added to the numerical values of stem:[h], stem:[e], stem:[k], and stem:[N_("A")], using values based on the most recent CODATA adjustment,

      from which it follows that the SI will continue to have the present set of seven base units, in particular

      * the kilogram will continue to be the unit of mass, but its magnitude will be set by fixing the numerical value of the Planck constant to be equal to exactly 6.626 06X ×10^−34^ when it is expressed in the SI unit stem:["m"^(2) * "kg" * "s"]^−1^, which is equal to stem:["J" * "s"],
      * the ampere will continue to be the unit of electric current, but its magnitude will be set by fixing the numerical value of the elementary charge to be equal to exactly 1.602 17X ×10^−19^ when it is expressed in the SI unit stem:["s" * "A"], which is equal to stem:["C"],
      * the kelvin will continue to be the unit of thermodynamic temperature, but its magnitude will be set by fixing the numerical value of the Boltzmann constant to be equal to exactly 1.380 6X ×10^−23^ when it is expressed in the SI unit stem:["m"^(2) * "kg" * "s"]^−2^ stem:["K"]^−1^, which is equal to stem:["J" * "K"]^−1^,
      * the mole will continue to be the unit of amount of substance of a specified elementary entity, which may be an atom, molecule, ion, electron, any other particle or a specified group of such particles, but its magnitude will be set by fixing the numerical value of the Avogadro constant to be equal to exactly 6.022 14X ×stem:[10^(23)] when it is expressed in the SI unit stem:["mol"]^−1^.

      The General Conference on Weights and Measures
  - type: noting
    date_effective: '2011-10-21'
    message: |-
      *further notes* that since

      * the new definitions of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin and mole are intended to be of the explicit-constant type, that is, a definition in which the unit is defined indirectly by specifying explicitly an exact value for a well-recognized fundamental constant,
      * the existing definition of the metre is linked to an exact value of the speed of light in vacuum, which is also a well-recognized fundamental constant,
      * the existing definition of the second is linked to an exact value of a well-defined property of the caesium atom, which is also an invariant of nature,
      * although the existing definition of the candela is not linked to a fundamental constant, it may be viewed as being linked to an exact value of an invariant of nature,
      * it would enhance the understandability of the International System if all of its base units were of similar wording,

      the International Committee for Weights and Measures will also propose

      the reformulation of the existing definitions of the second, metre and candela in completely equivalent forms, which might be the following:

      * the second, symbol stem:["s"], is the unit of time; its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom, at rest and at a temperature of stem:[0 "K"], to be equal to exactly 9 192 631 770 when it is expressed in the SI unit stem:["s"]^−1^, which is equal to stem:["Hz"],
      * the metre, symbol stem:["m"], is the unit of length; its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum to be equal to exactly 299 792 458 when it is expressed in the SI unit stem:["m" * "s"]^−1^,
      * the candela, symbol stem:["cd"], is the unit of luminous intensity in a given direction; its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency stem:[540 * 10^(12) "Hz"] to be equal to exactly 683 when it is expressed in the SI unit stem:["m"]^−2^ stem:["kg"^(-1) * "s"^(3) * "cd" * "sr"], or stem:["cd" * "sr" * "W"]^−1^, which is equal to stem:["lm" * "W"]^−1^.

      In this way, the definitions of all seven base units will be seen to follow naturally from the set of seven constants given above.

      In consequence, on the date chosen for the implementation of the revision of the SI:

      * the definition of the kilogram in force since 1889 based upon the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram (1st meeting of the CGPM, 1889, 3rd meeting of the CGPM, 1901) will be abrogated,
      * the definition of the ampere in force since 1948 (9th meeting of the CGPM, 1948) based upon the definition proposed by the International Committee (CIPM, 1946, Resolution 2) will be abrogated,
      * the conventional values of the Josephson constant stem:[K_(J-90)] and of the von Klitzing constant stem:[R_(K-90)] adopted by the International Committee (CIPM, 1988, Recommendations 1 and 2) at the request of the General Conference (18th meeting of the CGPM, 1987, Resolution 6) for the establishment of representations of the volt and the ohm using the Josephson and quantum Hall effects, respectively, will be abrogated,
      * the definition of the kelvin in force since 1967/68 (13th meeting of the CGPM, 1967/68, Resolution 4) based upon a less explicit, earlier definition (10th meeting of the CGPM, 1954, Resolution 3) will be abrogated,
      * the definition of the mole in force since 1971 (14th meeting of the CGPM, 1971, Resolution 3) based upon a definition whereby the molar mass of carbon 12 had the exact value stem:[0.012 "kg" * "mol"]^−1^ will be abrogated,
      * the existing definitions of the metre, second and candela in force since they were adopted by the CGPM at its 17th (1983, Resolution 1), 13th (1967/68, Resolution 1) and 16th (1979, Resolution 3) meetings, respectively, will be abrogated.

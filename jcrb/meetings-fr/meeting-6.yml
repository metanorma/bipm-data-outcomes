  - In principle, a non-connected NMI has to agree with one of the existing RMOs that
    that RMO will take care of the interests of the NMI concerned and in particular
    carry out the intra-regional review of its CMCs. The NMI has to join in activities
    and comparisons organised by that RMO. Once an RMO has been chosen, all of the
    CMCs of that NMI must pass through this RMO.

  - Comparaisons
  considerations: []
  actions: []
  x-unparsed:
  - RMO supplementary comparisons have to follow the same rules as key comparisons
    for their results to be published in Appendix B after a review of the CC concerned.
    Bilateral comparisons can go in Appendix B as well. The BIPM will draft some guidance
    on this issue.

    CIPM MRA: Each RMO to prepare bullet points identifying, from their perspective, the benefits and the successes of the CIPM MRA. The intention is to eventually combine these into a single presentation to be made at the CGPM as an introduction to the Draft Resolution to be presented at the 25th meeting of the CGPM on the CIPM MRA. It is envisaged that the common points will be compiled and supplemented by RMO specific perspectives (one slide per RMO). BIPM will add introductory statistics, and the presentation will conclude with progress already made towards a sustainable CIPM MRA and as an introduction to the Draft Resolution.

    RMOs to coordinate and send the common and RMO specific bullet points to the BIPM (JCRB Executive Secretary) by the end of May, 2014 so that the presentation can be discussed at the June meeting of the CIPM bureau.

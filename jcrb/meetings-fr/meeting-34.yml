    The policy for reporting comparisons that involve non-signatories to the CIPM MRA is clarified according to the following text:
    "Measurement comparison reports should be written to reflect the experiment that was actually performed, including summary results from all participants. These reports should be accessible from the online Key Comparison Database, but the graphs and tables of equivalence explicitly shown should include results only from signatory NMIs and DIs.
    The results for non-signatory participants should be considered as evidence of metrological competence for any future CMC submissions in the event that the laboratory becomes a signatory to the CIPM MRA.
    Note: This would not apply to laboratories participating in a measurement comparison under less stringent rules than the signatory laboratories (e.g. as a 'pilot study' participant for a measurement comparison in chemistry)."

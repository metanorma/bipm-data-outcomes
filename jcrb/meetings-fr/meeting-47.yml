    message: |-
      The JCRB noted that there are sometimes multiple iterations of comments between reviewers and writer during the JCRB review. The JCRB encourages:

      * the RMOs to ensure that the intra-RMO review is always carried out thoroughly so that points of detail are resolved before the JCRB review,
      * the CC WGs on the CIPM MRA and RMO stem:["TC"]/WGs to consider providing a mechanism to exchange comments during the JCRB review in a way that is transparent, and
      * the sharing of best practice between CC WGs on the CIPM MRA for efficient JCRB review.

  categories:
  - CMC review
  - CMCs
  considerations:
  - type: recalling / further recalling
    date_effective: '2023-09-13'
    message: The JCRB recalled that each RMO can approve each CMC before it is published
      and has the opportunity to indicate whether it will review a CMC or not. The
      CMC review process is tied to the deadline of the latest review date indicated
      by an RMO. The JCRB requests the RMOs to respond promptly even if they do not
      plan to review, and to remind Reviewers that agreeing to carry out a review
      of a CMC but not completing the review causes delays to the CMC review process.

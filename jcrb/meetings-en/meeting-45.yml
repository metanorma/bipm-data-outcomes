    message: The JCRB noted that the RMOs have progressed successfully with a mix
      of in-person, online and hybrid periodic reviews of quality management systems
      of the institutes in their regions. The JCRB encouraged the RMOs to further
      develop these review routes and keep to the 5-year review period. Exceptionally,
      where this is not possible, they may extend the validity of these QMSs subject
      to a case-by-case evaluation by the RMO concerned. This extension of validity
      shall be for a period not exceeding one year. The power to grant such extensions
      will be re-evaluated at the time of the 46th meeting of the JCRB.

    message: The JCRB noted that the RMOs have submitted reports to the JCRB on the
      status of the quality management systems of the institutes in its regions using
      a variety of different formats and content. The JCRB reminded the RMOs that
      the expected content is outlined in CIPM MRA-G-12 Section 5. To simplify the
      reporting obligation, the JCRB requests the JCRB Executive Secretary to draft
      a template and to circulate it to all RMOs for their comments in 3 monthsâ€™ time.

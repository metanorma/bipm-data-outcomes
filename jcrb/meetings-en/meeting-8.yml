      It was agreed that:

      1. If, for example, three RMOs agree to review a CMC and two do not then these two have abandoned their prerogative to review the CMC at any later stage.

      2. RMOs are to provide the following:

      * acknowledgement of the receipt of the CMC, plus
      * the date by which they will review the CMC, plus
      * the reviewer's name. This will, in most cases, be a stem:["TC"] Chairman. The name of the reviewer is to be provided so that reviews can be followed up.

      3. An automated reminder will be sent to all RMOs if no acknowledgement of a CMC is received within 3 weeks.

      4. The Secretary will send out a reminder after 3 weeks of the review deadline given by an RMO. This will be sent to both the individual responsible and the RMO contact.

      5. stem:["A"] log book will be set up to sit behind each CMC to provide an "at a glance" synopsis of the status of the CMC. This will be accessible to RMO reviewers to allow them to provide information on the status of the review.

      6. If an RMO review deadline has to change, it is the reviewer's responsibility to notify the JCRB Chairman.

      7. Every 3 months, the Executive Secretary will send out a summary document of the status of all CMCs.

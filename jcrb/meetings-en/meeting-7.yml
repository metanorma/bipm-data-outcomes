  - This certificate is consistent with the capabilities that are included in Appendix
    C of the MRA drawn up by the CIPM. Under the MRA, all participating institutes
    recognize the validity of each other's calibration and measurement certificates
    for the quantities, ranges and measurement uncertainties specified in Appendix
    C (for details see https://www.bipm.org).

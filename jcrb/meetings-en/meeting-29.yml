    message: |-
      The JCRB resolves that, whilst the expectation and routine practice is that NMIs will participate in repeats of relevant comparisons supporting CMCs organized by CC or RMOs, it is not within the remit of a CC to initiate the greying-out CMCs where an NMI has not participated. +
      It is the responsibility of the RMO stem:["TC"] for QMS review to establish the continued validity of all published CMCs covered by the quality system, taking into account all supporting technical evidence, including participation in comparisons. If the stem:["TC"] for QMS review is not satisfied that a particular CMC remains valid then it initiates the process of greying out the CMC in question.

    how the (5) RMOs undertake their tasks\n\t\tLearning how the (9) CCs undertake
    their tasks\n\t\n\t\n\tTo agree actions/recommendations to disseminate/adopt and
    implement the \"best practices\" / opportunities for further efficiencies identified\".\n\t(If
    time permits), to extend the scope of the above with a session addressing \"re-review\"."

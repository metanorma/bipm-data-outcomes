  x-unparsed:
  - The JCRB acknowledge that although the meeting do not foresee at present the possibility
    to suggest to the CIPM a new RMO in the Arabic region in the framework of the
    CIPM MRA due to the present shortage of Members of the BIPM and Associates of
    the CGPM within the proposed entities as well as an insufficiency of general knowledge
    of RMO issues, there is a need to further the knowledge of the role of such a
    RMO. The JCRB therefore asks AFRIMETS to proceed with their offer that their membership
    will be requested to allow the Arab countries outside Africa to participate in
    the activities of AFRIMETS, as an interim measure.

      reports from NMIs in which NMIs report any changes which may affect CMCs, resolves

      that RMOs review the templates used for these annual reports to ensure that
      NMIs address this issue. The JCRB further notes that in some areas, CCs may
      wish to make a specific decision on the review period and review procedure which
      applies to their community.'

      for consideration by the Committee on what procedure to follow when an NMI provides
      a unique capability that, therefore, cannot be the subject of comparisons with
      other NMIs. NOTE: The Statement proposed is as follows: Occasionally, NMIs offer
      unique calibration or measurement capabilities, whose confidence can not be
      underpinned by interlaboratory comparisons. The JCRB recommends that, in those
      cases, experts from other NMIs are asked to review the CMC claim, based on the
      "Criteria for acceptance of data for Appendix stem:["C"]" (Document JCRB-8/13(1b)).'

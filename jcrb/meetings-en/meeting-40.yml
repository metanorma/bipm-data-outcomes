    message: The JCRB agrees that the Hybrid Comparison scheme proposed by APMP may
      be used as an example of "Other available knowledge and experience" in Section
      3 of CIPM MRA D-04, which underpins CMCs. It was noted that the use of Hybrid
      Comparisons is not an alternative to participation in key or supplementary comparisons
      when accessible. It was also noted that it is not intended to include Hybrid
      Comparisons within Appendix B of the KCDB. This agreement is to be sent to the
      CIPM for approval in order to expedite communication to the Consultative Committees.
